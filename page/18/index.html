        <p>
            Yesterday around 8.30 pm, I was already sitting on the sofa waiting for the Wimbledon men’s final between Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer. I hoped Nadal could win to stop Federer’s winning streak on grass and take away the trophy Federer had possessed for the last five years.

Wimbledon has a new king. Rafael Nadal dethroned Roger Federer after a five-year reign by winning the longest-ever Wimbledon men’s final.

高中毕业典礼开始了。我并没有感到特别的兴奋。我顺理成章地来了，又顺理成章地走了。
可惜的是我最喜欢的校长没有出席。

            Today, at 14:28 in the school stadium, I stood in silent tribute along with all the staff and students for 3 minutes.
Our head master sobbed during his speech on the disastrous earthquake happened in Sichuan Province a week ago, when he spoke of the children there not being able to fulfill their dreams of getting quality education. He also expressed gratitude to everyone who cares and helps the suffering people in Sichuan.

 my parents will never support the idea of me travelling with my friends without supervision.

            Under almost desperate circumstances, the Dallas Mavericks and the players of Chelsea have won vital victories.
After watching these two games, I realized when you have the ability and courage, faith helps you to achieve your goal. I believe it’s the same when taking exams.

“I’m waiting for the series to really get going,” Mavs coach Avery Johnson said, “and hopefully keep improving for our guys.”
“The energy was great in the building for us,” said Nowitzki, who scored a game-high 32. “The fans got us hyped early.”
“Our defense was a lot better. We were scrambling, going after loose balls and once we got the rebound, [Jason] Kidd was off to the races.
