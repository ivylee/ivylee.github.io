This becomes increasingly ineffective as the amount of data output rises exponentially through accelerated\ndevelopment, and human pattern recognition is ill-suited to highly multi-dimensional decision making.\nUsing machine learning techniques such as Bayesian Optimization to learn complex trends (that would not be obvious to\nhuman researchers) in high-order data output space helps to guide future experiments and achieve design objectives effciently.</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
