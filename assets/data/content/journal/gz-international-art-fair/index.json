Her paintings have such\nstriking colors that immediately attracts everyone entered through the\neast gate. They’re rich, full of light, energy and love and passion for\nlife. To me, they’re more than Van Gogh’s Sun Flowers. photos will be\nadded later.\\\nIsabelle’s paintings are the most wonderful of the whole show. I’m a\nlittle disappointed by the works of Chinese artists. Even I can tell\nthey’re lack of creativity.\\\nWhen I was in a french artist’s spot, I heard a man judging her work.\nAt first I thought he meant well, and I did a little translation for him\nand Ms.Maryline, the artist. But later, the Chinese man became not so\nrespectful in choosing his words. He said something about his study of\nChinese culture and technology. I wonder what kind of man studies\nculture and technology at the same time? He was enjoying himself,\nclearly, saying the artist’s work of cultural mix was shallow, at least\nthe reflection of both French culture and Chinese culture was not deep\nenough. I hated to do that, translating everything as the man asked. And\nI hated myself for not being able to find some nice words to soften his\nopinion. Ms.Maryline explained she was only in China for 2 yrs and the\nman showed no comprehension for that. The errogant man judged, did not\nappreciate.\\\nAfter receiving souvenir from Ms.Maryline, we ran away asap from the\nman. The rest of the journey wasn’t as exciting as before. Soon we left\nfor lunch at the M.</p>\n<p>Created by X&#x26;Y</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
