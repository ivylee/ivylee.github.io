A cute little tram that travels only within a short distance.\nWalking on, I discovered plenty of seniors and kids with nannies enjoying their day,\nand an open-air ballroom under the bridge where the dancing and the music happen.\nIt's definitely much more crowded and full of life compared to when I first moved in to this neighborhood,\nabout 10 years ago.</p>\n<p>More than anything else, I miss the food here.\nI tried rice noodles with Shantou beef balls in a neighborhood restaurant yesterday with my mother,\nit was awesome. I also made sure to eat curry fish balls from 7-11 that I couldn't find in any 7-11 in the US.\nThe old and trusted restaurants are still around, with plenty of new and upcoming competitors.\nBut the prices seem to be 20% higher than before.</p>\n<p>Banking and mobile services are disappointing, for anyone spoiled by the efficiency of the US.\nI spent more than 2 hours in the bank to do something that need not to be done ever in the US.\nI visited 3 stores just to find out the prepaid plans I saw online are not available in store,\nbecause of lower margin.</p>\n<p>(To be continued...)</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
