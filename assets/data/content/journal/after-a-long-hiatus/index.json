Took me almost 4 nights. Essentially the problems for me were:</p>\n<p>I didn't push the markdown files that are supposed to be under <code>source/_posts</code> to github.\nSo I only have a bunch of published html files waiting to be converted back to markdown.\nDuring conversion it's tricky to deal with Chinese characters, took me 1-2 nights to figure out.\nLoading Octopress markdown files to Ghost database. There's a nice script available however some tweaks were needed to suit my use case.\nI decided not to integrate Disqus comments for now. Don't worry I still have your previous comments in heart.</p>\n<p>Please check out <a href=\"https://github.com/ivylee/octoghost\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">this</a> repo if you're wondering whether my experience might be helpful to you.</p>\n<p>Finally I like the combination of <a href=\"https://ghost.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Ghost</a> + <a href=\"https://github.com/axitkhurana/buster\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Buster</a> + <a href=\"https://pages.github.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Github Pages</a>\nas described <a href=\"https://jackpearce.com/have-a-lightning-fast-blog-and-host-it-for-free\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</a> :) And I'm writing again!</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
