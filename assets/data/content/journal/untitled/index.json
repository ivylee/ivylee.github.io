It only lasted a month. Then, 3 years later, now I’ve\ngraduated from senior high and there’s time for me to continue my study\nof french. But unfortunately, what I learned the first day in the french\nclass was that I had forgotten nearly everything about french except for\nthe pronounciation. Then I struggled. I couldn’t follow the teacher so I\nreviewed the lessons I learnt 3 years ago. I’m glad that I’m getting\nthrough this.\\\nIn classes given by Chinese teacher, it’s mainly about grammar. In\nclasses given by Maurice Jacque, it’s absolutely french. I find it hard\nto follow him word by word though in all, I understand what he means. He\nusually wants us to explain some particular words, in french, but all I\ncould do is to find something similiar from english. I just can’t talk\nin french! This is too bad.\\\nDeux\\\nMaurice est un grand homme.\\\nHe’s really strong, physically. One thing maybe indicates a little\nfrench of him is he forms a small tail with his hair.\\\nIn the morning today, we should have begun classes around 9 am. But\nMaurice was about 20 mins late. He explained that the lock on his door\nwas broken and he didn’t find out until he was to leave. So he spoke to\nthose security stuff but nobody understood him. Pauvre Maurice!\nNaturally, he extended today’s class by 25 mins to make up for the lost\ntime.\\\nTrois\\\nOn n’elle aime pas.\\\nThere’s this around 21-year-old girl in the french class. Her voice is\nloud and clear. She’s not afraid of asking questions, no matter smart or\nstupid, and she doesn’t care if it’s in the middle of the class. After a\nfew attempts to break the fluency of the class, which she succeeded\nanyway, she annoyed some of the fellow students. For me, she’s too eager\nto know the answer to the question that pops up in her mind. In some\ncases, Miss Zou had just finished explaining something difficult\nthoroughly, this girl asked the same question right the way. She seemed\nto be too devoted in making notes that she hadn’t heard any of the\nteacher’s words. I can’t say I’m annoyed but I think that was impolite,\npausing the class just to answer your questions, and sometimes, stupid\nquesions. She should’ve left those to after-class.\\\nThen in Maurice’s second class, when Maurice was talking about voyelles\nand consonnes or something like that, she demanded Maurice to teach\nsomething more difficult. She thought what we were learning was too easy\nand we shoudn’t waste time in those because there were so many lessons\nfollowing. Another one or two agreed with her. Maurice asked us to vote\nwhether we should go faster. I was neutral. She said in a even louder\ntone to make other agree with her. Maurice then said seriously, “I want\neverybody’s opinion, not your opinion!” I wasn’t sure about the ‘!’ but\nit was the loudest tone Maurice had used. Finally, she couldn’t get her\nway.\\\nThe next morning, I came back to the classroom, found this\n“教室是大家的教室，老师是大家的老师。请某位同学自重，否则，面斥不雅。”\non the blackboard. It was cruel! Other students were also surprised. My\ndeskmate told me it was written by a ‘teacher’. I couldn’t figure out\nwhom she meant. There she came. No expressions on her face. She went out\nfor water, then came back, picked up a piece of chalk, and wrote\n“每个人都有表达意见的权利。当面不说，背后议论，毛主席说是小人。” It\nbecame a drama. The peak of emotion had come and gone. After that, there\nwere much less questions from her during class. Later, I’ve discovered\nthat she came to class by an old bicycle that resembles my grandpa’s.\\\nQuatre\\\nJ’ai un nouveau téléphone portable Nokia N78.\\\nI’m really satisfied with it.
