The whole\nfamily knew the date of the deaths of both my sister and brother had\ncome. It was like the darkest day of my life. Both my sister and brother\nhad a strange disease which would cause their deaths by the time they\nreached certain age. My family had tried every possible method to escape\nthis curse but in vain, the time of death had arrived. Thinking all\nabout this, I didn’t have the courage to face them. Finally, I found my\nbrother, and he was so quiet. He knew all his life, that the end would\nbe like this. He didn’t say a word to me but I could see he was in the\ngreatest pain. Knowing the fact but could do nothing to change it was\nthe most unacceptable part. I just fell in his arms and cried. Then I\nsaw my sister with red and tearful eyes, she comforted me.\\\nThat was the end of my dream. I felt I was lucky to get out of that\ndream ASAP cause it really frightened me. Then I remembered the other\ndream I had about death, in which I died, I tried to find some\nresemblance, but nothing. The only thing I’ve learnt from these dreams\nis that I am extremely afriad of death. I don’t want to die now, I don’t\nwant anyone around me to die.</p>\n<p>Created by X&#x26;Y</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
