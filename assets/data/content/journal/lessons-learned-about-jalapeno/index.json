As usual Julio likes to add a Jalapeño into the mix. I cut it the way I cut other vegetables, using my fingers to fix it while cutting it with a knife. About 5 minutes later, I started to feel very hot in my nails. I went to the bathroom to wash my hands with soap, and accidentally touched my nostrils with my fingers. I felt it burning in my nose! And my nails! Soap doesn't help!</p>\n<p>The hot sensation lasted until this morning. I also accidentally touched my eyes with my fingers, HOT!</p>\n<p>I am facinated by the power of the chemical substance in the Jalapeño pepper, and the fact that finger nails, nostrils, eyes can react the same way to that substance by generating the HOT sensation, just as the tongue!</p>\n<p>I will remember Julio said that his mother cuts it with a fork, no touching with fingers!</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
