I said in my programme notes that a win was an\nabsolute must today,” declared Terry after the game.\\\n\\\n“We’ve got the win, with two great goals from Bally [Michael\nBallack].”\\\n\\\n“We got a free-kick from Didier [Drogba] on the edge of the half-way\nline. We should have killed the game and put it long as we did most of\nthe game to Didier,” said a rueful Terry. “We rushed the free-kick,\nwhich shouldn’t be done. We should have killed it off then.”\\\n\\\n“I think you’ve seen today, clearly, it’s in all our minds, we want to\nwin the Premiership and take it away from Man United,” he said.\\\n\\\n“We’ve got the advantage today - we’ve beaten them at home - we’ve not\nlost at home in a long time.\\\n\\\n“We’ve shown people today. All season long we’ve had to put up with\n‘Chelsea can’t play as well as Man United or Arsenal’, I think we showed\npeople today we can match anybody on our day.”\\\n\\\n<strong><em>Chet Winter, Goal.com</em></strong></p>\n<p>Created by X&#x26;Y</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
