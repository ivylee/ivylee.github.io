In our interview, however, she tended to\nbe surprisingly quiet. Discussing the colors used in her printings,\nIsabelle explained that the red color, her favorite color, symbolizes\nthe power of life. Different viewers will appreciate her works from\ndifferent angels.</p>\n<p>Isabelle’s works range from sculpture, watercolor, oil painting to\nprint and feature landscapes and Mediterranean figures as the subjects.\nShe created the skills of oil paintings on thick pasteboard, which is\nnow being widely introduced to universities of fine art.</p>\n<p><strong>Art to me is as water to fish</strong></p>\n<p>Asked which is her favorite medium, Isabelle blurted out without\nhesitation “All are important.” As the child in the artistically\ninherited family, Isabelle began to study painting at the age of 3.\nUnder Parisian artists’ instruction, she soon acquainted herself in the\nart world.</p>\n<p>Isabelle appraises herself as an inner-hot/outer-cold person. “I would\nlike to show the hottest part on the paper. Art is important in my life,\nas important as the water to fish.</p>\n<p><strong>The first western artist invited by Guangzhou Art Fair</strong></p>\n<p>Famed in the worldly art and collection circle, Isabelle has showcased\nher works in dozens of countries around the world. Over 600 masterpieces\nare now treasured in the private collectors’ houses. From entering the\nmarket circulation, her works have roughly appreciated over 10 times.</p>\n<p>Isabelle’s serendipity with China can be traced back 20 years ago. In\n1987, her solo exhibition in Beijing was the first one by a foreign\nartist since 1949, when New China was founded. In 2004, the year of\nSino-French culture exchange, Isabelle brought her works to the Shanghai\nArt Fair.</p>\n<p>Isabelle was the first western artist invited by the 11th Guangzhou\nInternational Art Fair in 2006. This year, she comes back as a V.I.P. to\njoin the 12th, together with 60 pieces, the same pieces which are\nconsidered hits from her former exhibitions.</p>\n<p><strong>Masterpiece as gift to Guangzhou Museum</strong></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Isabelle will donate one of her paintings to the Guangzhou\nMuseum during the Guangzhou tour. The painting entitled “la Calanque,”\nvalued at over one million RMB in the art market, is as significant as\nIsabelle’s amulet. Wherever Isabelle goes for exhibition, she brings it\nwith her.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.lifeofguangzhou.com/node_10/node_35/node_116/node_610/img/2007/11/28/119622680030946_2.jpg\" alt=\"la-calanque\"></p>\n<p>la Calanque</p>\n<p>The painting portrays a scene of huge stones, hot sunshine and cool\nbeach, symbolizing the pursuit of dream and the satisfaction of reaching\ngoal. Mr. Jacques TOUBON, the minister of French Culture Department,\nalso expresses his great fondness to the works.</p>\n<p><strong>Guangzhou is like the south part of France</strong></p>\n<p>Having visited China’s Beijing and Shanghai, Isabelle’s affection\ntoward Guangzhou is no doubt. She said, Guangzhou reminds her of the\nsouth part in France. The art atmosphere is similar and ultimately\ndynamic.</p>\n<p>At the end of our interview, Isabelle disclosed that she would have a\nseries of promotion plans in her China tour soon.</p>\n<p>(By Jessie Hwang, Kimberly Barteau, works by courtesy of Ms. Isabelle)</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
