Didn’t begin working until 8 pm.\\\nI learned today that John Lennon said “Time you enjoy wasting, was not\nwasted.”. This gave myself a justification for not doing anything\nrelated to work or study.\\\nTomorrow I shall go out, breathe the air and start fresh. But I don’t\nsee myself sitting in the library in the next couple days.\\\nThe good thing about staying at school on weekends is that I can sleep\nfor as long as I desire without being disturbed by my grandparents or\nparents or construction workers. The bad thing is that I’ve got to look\nfor food myself and it takes me a long time to decide whether to eat sth\nor not. I hope I could skip all my meals but my stomach protested. I\ncame to believe being hungry is better than being full so I ate little.\nIs it also the effect of the night spent in the library?</p>\n<p>Created by X&#x26;Y</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
