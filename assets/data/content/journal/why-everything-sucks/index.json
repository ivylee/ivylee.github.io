I don’t want to wear a shirt with my teacher’s name on it,\nespecially when I hate him! How am I going to explain to others when\nthey ask what’s this shirt about? It would be most embarrassing. So I\nguess I won’t wear it for a second time.\\\nconclusion: students in charge of my class are idiots. I have to\nsurvive under idiot leaders.</p>\n<p>Created by X&#x26;Y</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
