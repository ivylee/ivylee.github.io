I\nwas on a geographical study tour organized by school with teachers and\nfriends walking in the street of Hong Kong. The street was in chaos, I\nbelieved, and we called the police. The police's reply was that under\nthe special circumstances like that, the police force couldn't help us.\nWe were on our own. Then the camera moved to another stage where the\ngroup of us were walking up a slope. Suddenly a grenade-like object fell\nfrom the sky and I yelled 'Everyone get down!' but nobody listened until\na few secs later it exploded. I was on the ground covering my head while\nsome of my friends got injured. Not long after that, men in black jumped\nout of all the vans nearby and pointed their gun at us. We had no option\nbut to do as they said. We were taken to the basement of an abandoned\nbuilding. They told us to line up and sit down. We all followed their\ninstruction. Then they began to shoot us, one by one. My friends died in\nfront of me. Out of nowhere, my hand grabbed a gun. I was almost lying\non the ground when I tried so hard to shoot the bad guys. What I did was\nin vain. Finally a bullet went through my heart and I was dead. That was\nwhen I woke up, shivering. I was so afraid that what I dreamt might\nactually happen one day. Then I went back into the dream to see if there\nwas a slightest chance to turn things around. Although my body was dead,\nI was conscious. Things went on as the movie The Butterfly Effect. I\ntried to pretend to be a doctor and said I was of value to them. I even\ndressed the leader's injury. Nothing went on. Then I jumped to the scene\nwhen I was running after my teacher. He was supposed to protect me and\nwe were supposed to get out of there together. We ran from the basement\nto the top of the building. Apparently there was no way to go any\nfurther. My dream stuck there and ended.\\\nPart Deux\\\nA few days earlier, I had another weird dream. [The maths teacher who\ntaught me during senior 2 is called M. And now my maths teacher is\ncalled G.] M's baby was born a couple of months ago so M had been taking\nvacation to look after his wife and baby. But he returned one day to\nteach us. We had been taught by G ever since we were senior 3. We didn't\nknow that G was a substitute for the period. But the problem was that\nwe(more specifically, I) like G very much and I hate M. M was old,\nboring and annoying. But my memory flashed back to the first day G met\nus. His words suggested he was not permanent. It was then did I know M\nwas to teach us instead of G. As I was thinking about it, M started his\nlesson and G was sitting on the right side of the classroom. G was\nsmiling, quietly paying attention to M, like M was his teacher. We were\nangry about M teaching us again. So once we had the chance, we laughed\nat him. We expressed our dissatisfaction in every possible way but M\nstill wouldn't go away, G was still smiling gently. That was when I woke\nup, asking myself \"R U out of ur mind?\". I don't know what I think about\nlater. I just put it behind.\\</p>\n<p>Created by X&#x26;Y</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
