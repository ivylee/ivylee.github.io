(just click the big github picture on the right and you’ll see)</p>\n<p>for pidgin,</p>\n<p>it supports more protocols with plugins which i don’t need. it supports\nmsn protocol but sometimes just doesn’t work. it supports fetion which\nmay be the cause of crashes. it supports file transfer but i only\nexchange small files with huntxu. and it’s absolutely much larger than\nirssi.</p>\n<p>arch linux+awesome+irssi: keep it simple and stupid.</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
