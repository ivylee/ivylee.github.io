I see learning to be a doctor a great\nchallenge to myself. But no one in my family supported this idea. They\nthought I was idealistic and would soon lose interest. And they tried to\ntalk me out of it by describing poor working conditions and painful\nfaces of patients. Frankly I didn’t consider that much. I just wanted to\nget an M.D. and then throw myself into volunteering work, to help people\nwho need help. How can that be difficult?\\\nI gave up.\\\nAfter all the work my father had done, I still couldn’t be admitted by\nthe university I desired. Then my dream collapsed. I would never be able\nto achieve that. I gave in to reality. I comfort myself that to be an\nactuary is also challenging and I could earn great money from this\ncareer. My whole family seemed happy and content, they even thought my\nfailure to pursue medicine is destined. I was extremely desperate but I\ncan only tell them to fuck off in my mind. What a coward I am!\\\nI must\\\nearn a lot of money. Then take some time off to pursue medicine. Then\nmove to Ireland and build a seaside glass house. Nothing could stop me.</p>\n<p>Created by X&#x26;Y</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
