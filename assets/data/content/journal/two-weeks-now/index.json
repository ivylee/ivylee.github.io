It seemed everyone just trying to grab\ntheir old familiar friends instead of trying to make new acquaintances.\nAs I understand the situation, I think making new friends while we\nmaintain old friendships is necessary. After all, we have to be with new\nclassmates for the next 2 years. How can we not be known to each other?\\\nAbout the teachers, I found something very interesting. Facts about\nteachers are often talked by students, especially facts beside he/she as\na teacher. My new math teacher, L, is fond of music and he’s good at\ncomposing. I remembered once when I entered the office, he was singing\nChinese opera while working which really surprised me. There are many\nother things about a teacher that we talked about. And through the\ntalking, little things will spread quickly until they are known to some\ncertain number of people. They are not like rumors, but sort of news\nfrom the tabloids. Actually no one knows where the information came from\nor it’s true or not. But curiosity drove us to the joy of revealing some\nmystery.\\\nAbout my former math teacher: on 31st Aug. he was said to be the class\nteacher of Senior 2 Class 5; on 2nd Sept. he was not in the Senior 2\noffice; later he was said to be teaching Senior 1 and not much later he\nwas said to be teaching a junior class and Senior 1; the latest news is\nthat he is teaching Senior 1 Class 2&#x26;5 and is the classteacher of Senior\n1 Class 2.\\\nInteresting.\\</p>\n<p>Created by X&#x26;Y</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
