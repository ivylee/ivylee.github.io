As X10 focuses on concurrency there’s\nnew types and ‘struct’ as in C/C++. By using a simple example the class\ndiscussed common problems arise in concurrent computation, as appeared\nin using Hadoop.</p>\n<p>Based on what I’ve learned today it seems the advantage of X10 is\nconcurrency without the limitation of map-reduce paradigm. However X10\nis still under development, and seemed to be only used at IBM. Its\npopularity should increase by time, especially for tasks that are found\nto be difficult to tackle with Hadoop.</p>\n<p>Reference: <a href=\"http://x10-lang.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">http://x10-lang.org/</a></p>\n"}},"context":{}}
