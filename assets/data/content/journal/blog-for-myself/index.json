I put other\nblog links here just for convenience so I just open my own blog and\nclick through sth I might be interested in.\\\nSometimes I read friends’ blog for a whole afternoon, never knew why\nand how they can put so much into words. Maybe it’s the way I think,\nthat is different from others.\\\nAnd, I’m perfectly capable of being alone. I enjoy solitary. Guessed\nI’m too independent, too cold maybe?\\\nNext week will be all about X’mas, too busy to prepare for exams. I\nhate the thought that I have to be the best. I shall be satisfied by\njust passing all.\\\nDamn, it’s a difficult task. Just hang on!</p>\n<p>Created by X&#x26;Y</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
