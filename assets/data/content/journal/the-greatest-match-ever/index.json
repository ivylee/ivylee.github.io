I\nhoped Nadal could win to stop Federer’s winning streak on grass and take\naway the trophy Federer had possessed for the last five years.\\</p>\n<hr>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>Wimbledon has a new king. Rafael Nadal dethroned Roger Federer after a\nfive-year reign by winning the longest-ever Wimbledon men’s final.</p>\n<p>The consistently heartstopping 6-4, 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 6-7 (8-10), 9-7\nclassic began at 2.35pm and thanks to a couple of breaks for rain\n(surely necessary for the spectators to catch their breath), it ended at\n9.15pm with the 22-year-old from Mallorca dropping to the ground with\nhis arms outstretched in celebration.</p>\n<p>Watching the four hours and 48 minutes on-court action, from the vantage\npoint of the royal box, was Centre Court legend Bjorn Borg. Nadal had\nmatched the Swede’s fantastic feat of winning the Grand Slams of Roland\nGarros and Wimbledon back-to-back and had also prevented Federer\nsurpassing the five titles in a row he collected between 1976 and 1980.\\\n\\\nConditions for the latest duel between tennis’s two finest players\ncould not have been more demanding. The rain, which delayed the start\nfor 27 minutes, eventually cleared but the chill, gusting wind which\naccompanied it persisted throughout the match, blowing winning shots off\ncourse and making life even more difficult for the two competitors. That\nthey coped so well spoke volumes for their skill and adaptability.\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\nWith the five-time champion looking less than his authoritative best,\nit was Nadal who struck the first heavy blow, capitalising on successive\nFederer errors to break for a 2-1 lead.\\\n\\\nFrom the start Nadal concentrated his battering-ram attack on the\nFederer backhand, aiming every serve and looping forehand in that\ndirection and it kept the champion in an unaccustomed position - on the\nback foot. Federer prospered more when he switched to net-rushing but he\ncould not block Nadal’s inexorable advance towards the first set.\\\n\\\nThe Spaniard managed to fight off a break point to stay 3-1 ahead and\nhe needed to avert two more as he served for the set, which he clinched\non his third set point after 48 minutes, courtesy of another brace of\nground stroke errors from Federer.\\\n\\\nIt was the first set Federer had dropped since the final of the French\nOpen, when he was routed by the same Nadal.\\\n\\\nFederer’s counter-attack was immediate and it rushed him into a\nthree-game lead which he extended to an apparently commanding 4-1 with\nhis sixth and seventh aces, only for the irrepressible Nadal to bounce\nback with some thrilling, all-action stuff.\\\n\\\nTo Federer’s visible anger, his serve was broken as a stretched volley\nflew out of play and Nadal pulled level at 4-4 as Federer squandered yet\nanother break point.\\\n\\\nNow Nadal was in full, thrilling flow, breaking Federer again to lead\n5-4 with another huge forehand and celebrating with pumped fists. As he\nwas serving for the second set, Nadal received a warning from umpire\nPascal Maria of France for taking too long between serves.\\\n\\\nClearly unsettled by the timing of that censure, the Spaniard permitted\nFederer another break point on a wind-caused error, but in typical\nfashion dug deep and clinched the set when Federer once more mistimed a\nbackhand into the netting. So, having swept five games, Nadal was in the\ndriving set, two sets ahead.\\\n\\\nNadal’s authority suffered a scare in the third game of the third set\nwhen he slipped in making a sudden change of direction and called in the\ntrainer to check on his right knee. No time-out was requested by Nadal,\nthough his speed around court appeared to be affected for a while.</p>\n<p>He was at full stretch in the next game, fighting off two Federer break\npoints and, as dark clouds began to mass over Centre Court, the champion\nwent flat out to recover a set and get back into the match. But four\nmore break points went begging as Nadal held for 3-3 before wasting\nthree break points of his own which would have put him 4-3 ahead and\nperfectly positioned to win.\\\n\\\nInstead, with Federer leading 5-4, the expected downpour set in and\nplay was held up for one hour 20 minutes. On the resumption it was\nFederer who dominated when a tie-break was needed to resolve the set,\nhammering four aces to take it by seven points to five.\\\n\\\nThe fourth set did not contain a single break point for either man and\nwhen the second tie-break of the match arrived it was a sensation, with\nNadal first leading by five points to two and then reaching, and\nmissing, two Championship points before Federer levelled at two sets all\nwhen a Nadal backhand error left him the winner by 10 points to eight.\\\n\\\nAnother downpour drove the players off court for half an hour with the\nscore at 2-2 in the final set and when they returned the light was\nfading. But the spirit of both finalists burned bright as they hammered\nthe ball at each other just as eagerly as they had done when this\nmarathon first began.\\\n\\\nAt 3-4 Nadal saved a break point which would have left Federer serving\nfor the title. At 6-6 Federer saved a couple of break points. Finally,\nin the gloom, the Spaniard broke to lead 8-7 when Federer struck a\nforehand too long.\\\n\\\nSo Nadal served for the match again, getting to his third Championship\npoint only for Federer to hit an incredible backhand service return.\nDeuce once again, but Nadal moved to his fourth match point with a big\nserve and, with the crowd going wild, Federer finally cracked, dumping a\nforehand in the net.</p>\n<p>It was late, very late, but not too late for the coronation of a new\nking to begin.\\\n\\\n<a href=\"http://www.wimbledon.org/en_GB/news/match_reports/2008-07-06/200807061215376665046.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">[Match Reports: Nadal nicks title after five-set thriller, Sunday, 6\nJuly 2008, Written by <strong>Ronald Atkin</strong>\n]</a></p>\n<p>Created by X&#x26;Y</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
