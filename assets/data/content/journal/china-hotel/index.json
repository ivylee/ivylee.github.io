Entered a building of about ten years old, we took an elevator\nalso aged about ten, then we walked into a mini conference room. An\nofficer was expecting us and she went to set up the laptop and projecter\nas we asked and another officer came in with 2 cups of water and later\nanother cup. Just then the first officer, Olivia which she later\nintroduced herself as, informed us that we should be facing only two\nstudents, herself and the one who gave us water, later known as <em>sorry,\nI forgot</em> . We were actually shocked, literally shocked. We didn’t know\nwhat to do, how to teach the whole class of two officers. Based on the\nprevious communications with Olivia, whom Rose said was a fluent English\nspeaker, we decided right the way to jump to plan B which is designed\nfor high level students, of course the testing part was skipped. Olivia\ntold us that it should be a demo of our class which should last no more\nthan 35 mins, so we cut and cut and cut all the discussions and gave\nthem the main structure. At first I was nervous but after I did my part\nof introduction during which I made a little interaction with the 2\nstudents, I started to get on track. But I felt I was uneasy compared to\nRose and Vera. They tried their best to explain the structure of the\nspeech and useful phrases and I was supporting the falling writing\npaper. Surprisingly what interested them most was relaxation in the\nmiddle of the class. So we went through it smoothly.\\\nAfter the class was over, we had a little meeting with the 2 officers.\nThey pointed out that we spoke too fast, that we should take students’\nEnglish level into account and we should focus more on the common use of\nthe phrases. Oh no! We assumed they were high level students at the very\nbeginning! It was the major problem, other than that, I thought we were\nfine. After everything was settled, we left for 007.\\\nGoing to TeeMall(?) with Rose and Vera was great fun. We first bought\nthe movie tickets, then seperated to look for food, at last waited at\nthe cinema entrance. Just then I realized I had lost the ticket, three\nof us looking up and down, inside out of my bag and my pockets but it\nwas fruitless. So I sent them in and went out looking for that little\npiece of paper. I remembered my route but couldn’t find it. At last I\nwent to the entrance and asked if I could get in. The lady said I should\nask the sales window but when I got there, the miss said they had\nshifted and the person who sold me the ticket was gone and she couldn’t\nmake a decision. I raised my voice and she told me to go to the office.\nIn the office, I repeated everything and a man lead me in. Haha, finally\nI got in. Worth mentioning that I didn’t provide any prove that I had\npaid for my ticket and my friends were in the cinema.\\\nThe movie was boring, I still think Daniel Criag is too short. We went\nwindow shopping afterwards. It was exciting, all girl stuff. Trying\nshoes and make-ups and perfumes…\\\nI was planning to watch my friend modeling at the welcome-freshmen\nparty hosted in her university but instead I came to TeeMall. Luckily,\nthe show was broken in by the unexpected shower and I got to do that\nanother time!\\\nIt was crazy and we got in the subway only to hear the broadcast saying\nLine 4 had stopped service. I was so near home that I decided to go home\nand Rose and Vera together were to catch the last bus back to U. A brief\nfairwell, I was at home.</p>\n<p>Created by X&#x26;Y</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
