I didn’t feel that\nway. When April suggested they go to Paris, for me, it was déja vu.\nFrank, working as an ordinary officer for Knox(?), didn’t get any\nmeaning from his work. He was a man without passion, without life.\nApril, who studied acting to be an actress when she was young, buried\nher dream in daily routines as a housewife. April couldn’t endure the\nemptiness anymore, so she persuaded Frank to move to Paris where she’d\nsupport him by working as a secretary while he could take the time to\nexplore his real interests, what he inwardly desired to do. At first,\nthey were thrilled by the plan, but their neighbors and Frank’s\nco-workers made no sense of why they were giving up their life on\nRevolutionary Road. Only John, an insane ex-Mathamatician, understood\ntheir dream to live, to thrive again. Unexpectedly, Frank got a\npromotion and April got pregnant. April was determined to leave, ready\nfor abortion but Frank, who wouldn’t give up his opportunity and his\nchild, had second thoughts. They had a hard fight, then everything went\non as Frank wished. Only John saw the truth, the selfishness of Frank.\nOn the last morning, it seemed that April was getting back on track,\ncooking breakfast for Frank. At that very moment, I can see April’s\ndying, I just can tell. Then I think about the baby, April might kill\nhim/her first then commit suicide. So I waited and everything went on as\nexpected, except that I thought maybe, April wasn’t supposed to die from\nblood lost, which was an accident of her abortion. No one, including\nFrank, really understood April’s death. From April’s point of view, I\nrelived my life, the very few days just after I found out where I got\nadmitted. It was hell and I tried to run away from it. I told myself I\nwould not accept that and I wouldn’t go there, that wasn’t the life, the\ndestination I was looking for. So I went online and searched for foreign\nuniversities. I was determined to go to St Petersburg for the study of\nmedicine and I emailed to the admission office asking about details.\nThen, after a mental breakdown, I surrendered, to reality. I’m a coward,\ncompared to April. But I know that, April was different, much more\ndesperate than I was. I was still young, having the power to change my\nfuture. However she was in a dead end, she could never get out again.\nShe used to have dreams of becoming an actress, then marriage, children,\nso much boundary made her feel that she had lost identity. From a\npromising young girl with dream and passion, to one of millions of\nhousewives. Special to ordinary, passion to emptiness, life to death.\nFrank didn’t know what she wanted and their communication was broken.\nJohn was the only one who comprehend her feelings but could do nothing\nto help. People who couldn’t understand the movie are those lucky ones\nwho have never been through desperate situations where one is stuck in\ndarkness, helpless and hopeless. Did I have to courage to die? No. I\nfear death because there are so many things on earth I want to try. I\ndon’t know if I can do them all but as long as I live, there’s hope for\nme. But if I were in the state where April was in, I’d choose to leave\nRevolutionary Road and start over. April was too brave.</p>\n<p>Created by X&#x26;Y</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
