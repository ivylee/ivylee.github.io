Last night my mum found out I was watching\nBeautiful Thing then she told me not to watch ‘this kind of thing’ in a\nweird tone. She despised it clearly. That’s her, the most conservative\nperson I know.\\\nI don’t see gay a problem. They are just different. The tagline of\nBrokeback Mountain tells the truth-love is a force of nature. I should\nsay I feel the love between gay people is more tender, exquisite and\nsmooth. It’s a beautiful thing indeed. How come so many people think\nit’s sick? Please stop doing this. Everyone deserves to love and to be\nlove, equally.</p>\n<p>Created by X&#x26;Y</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
