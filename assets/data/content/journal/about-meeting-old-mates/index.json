I cannot say it’s\nstrong but it exists. Time brings it between me and the others. I just\ncan’t be like before. I honestly don’t know what to say. Maybe I love to\nisolate myself. I’m cool with not being a big talker. Don’t know if this\nis natural but I guess it is, at least for me. Some of them noticed that\nI’m different, quite beyond their expectation I guess. But I thought\nchanges were good things. How can someone not change after all these\nyears? In all, I felt like going further and further away from my past.\nI always run away from my past. There’s always something I don’t want to\nremember or think about. I need to go to a place where no one knows me.\nRun away. That’s what I do. Does it make me a coward?</p>\n<p>Created by X&#x26;Y</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
