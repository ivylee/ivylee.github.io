It was sad, cause after all this time, 7 yrs we didn’t get\nin touch in any possible way though we’ve always had each other’s name\non qq. He changed a lot. Each of us had forbidden topics and\nconversation could not proceed. Once again, the feeling of distance!\\\nI hate it. When I went back to HF for the (ridiculous) 120th\nAnniversary, I felt like a stranger. My mind kept whispering, ‘I don’t\nbelong here, I don’t belong here anymore’. This is me, who couldn’t say\na word to many familiar faces, who enjoyed silent company with an old\nfriend, the one I anxiously wanted to meet, who ran away from the past\nas fast as possible.\\\nClarified something, still a long way to go.\\\nFirst step of preparation.\\\nWinter break plans- 1st stage.\\\nRegret: didn’t spend enough time with X-2, including tonight’s outing…\\\nHope! Hope! Hope!\\\nStart fresh!</p>\n<p>Created by X&#x26;Y</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
