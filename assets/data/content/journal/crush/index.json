He was coming in and I was going out, chatting\nwith my friend. At once he captured my eyes. I wasn't so sure if that\nwas him. I confirmed by taking another glance and  was immediately\nattracted by his… I don't know how to describe it. And I looked right on\nhis face before he realized he was watched by someone. Then he looked at\nme, I looked at him. Right at that moment, I knew I was supposed to\ngreet him but I couldn't say a word. It felt like when I tried the\n跳楼机 for the first time, I was so moved by the beautiful scenary I saw\nin the sky. I didn't scream and I wished to stay in the sky for as long\nas possible. I guess he could have felt something strange about me.\\\nI think he's the handsomest among the leaders in our school. He was\nrealistic, and humorous, more of an inside person. I attended his\nclasses when I was in senior 1. He would come to the classroom early and\nplay classical music using the laptop before beginning lesson. He would\ntalk about his hobby including hi-fis and collecting Chinese acient\nteapots during class as examples of some economic phenomenon. I enjoyed\npretty much every minute of it.\\\nRecently I noticed he changed his dressing style. He casually leaves\nthe bottom part of his shirt out of trousers, unlike most of the\nteachers in our school. He looks more comfortable and charming now. I\nlike this change.\\</p>\n<p>Created by X&#x26;Y</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
