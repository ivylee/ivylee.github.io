Then Gerbino said to his men,\\\n“What’s that? You see that? Fantastic! I want that! Get me that!” Then\nhis men rushed to Count Dzerzhinsky.\\\nThen I realized, gun was an advanced weapon at that time.\\\nThere are also other funny lines which can be read here <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0437954/quotes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Memorable\nquotes for Memorable quotes for Virgin\nTerritory</a> ।\\\nMatthew Rhys in Virgin Territory\\</p>\n<p>Created by X&#x26;Y</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
