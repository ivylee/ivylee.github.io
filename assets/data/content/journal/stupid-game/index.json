I had\nalways thought it would be fun, but unfortunately I’m a moron. So I\ntried to collect 3 smart friends to be my companions. One of them was\nactually wise enough to leave us at 9:45 pm. The rest of us hopefully\narrived at the 24-hour study room, which was surprisingly small and\ncrowded. Then the long journey began.\\\nI was fully charged.
