My primary intention is to visit my\ngrandma who’s already 78 years old. However, this is a tiny city where\ninfomation about people coming and going spreads faster than you think,\nin such case, my mother said we couldn’t stay here without visiting her\nrather close relatives. So I had to follow her almost everywhere as I\nfelt it obligatory to do so.\\\nWent out to meet a friend at a KTV and I didn’t sing at all. It was\nalways awkard for me to go to kareokes because I rarely sing in front of\npeople, unless they’re really very close friends. Not until I had to\nlook up the map for transportation means did I realized that I lived far\nfrom downtown. There were only 2 bus lines out.\\\nThis is a boring city and its language sounds like french to me. I was\njust understanding very few words within any conversation. Sometimes\nfamiliar words pop up and disappear in less than a sec, and reappear and\ndisappear few secs later. Frustrating! But some words sound funny to\ncertain extent, which means I’d laugh when I hear them but my mother’d\nthink I’m crazy/stupid.\\\nLater I discovered, actually my mother discovered a funny line came\nfrom a loudspeaker on the street, outside a shoe shop. In mandarin it\nwas “平平钱，买双鞋穿趣味”. It rhymes with the sound ‘i’. Loudspeaker is\nthe symbol of stores selling low-price goods. Very often sound from the\nloudspeaker was a male/female’s voice saying ‘the goods are very cheap\nhere! come and buy! or u’ll regret it! because we’re closing up! this is\nur last chance!’. It’s clear that the speaker is playing what is\nrecorded over and over again that it sometimes becomes an unbearable\nnoise, just driving people away asap from the coverage of that speaker.\nHowever, that very line reflected the differences between people in ST\nand GZ. Here the people learned the style of selling from GZ and added\ntheir own language and attitude of life. They are casual, content though\ntheir living standard isn’t even comparable to that of GZ. I’ve never\nheard of Cantonese buying shoes just for fun and low-price, they care\nmore about brand and quality. My mother and I thought the line was so\nbrilliant that we deliberately went by that store to hear it again, and\nI asked her to repeated it for me several times on our way home.\\\nPaid a visit to the notorious boat-bridge which charges 60 for entrance\nfee, and the newly accomplished ST 1st Middle School campus. The later\nwas pretty much like the HEMC of GZ, beautiful but one of the\nadministrators, my mother’s uncle, told us it’ll take 6 yrs to fully pay\nthe debts, a long long way to go.\\\nWhen I stay in, I read and sleep and watch tv and surf the net and of\ncourse, write this. There’s nothing better to do. I’m glad I finished\nreading To Kill a Mocking Bird which is such a great novel, friendly\nwords with profound meanings.\\\nOne thing I have to mention particularly, is that I hate the motorbikes\nhere, they’re absolutely outrageous.\\\nlater</p>\n<p>Created by X&#x26;Y</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
