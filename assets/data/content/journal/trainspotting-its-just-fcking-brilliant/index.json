Choose a job. Choose a career. Choose a\nfamily. Choose a fucking big television, choose washing machines, cars,\ncompact disc players and electrical tin openers. Choose good health, low\ncholesterol, and dental insurance. Choose fixed interest mortgage\nrepayments. Choose a starter home. Choose your friends. Choose\nleisurewear and matching luggage. Choose a three-piece suite on hire\npurchase in a range of fucking fabrics. Choose DIY and wondering who the\nfuck you are on Sunday morning. Choose sitting on that couch watching\nmind-numbing, spirit-crushing game shows, stuffing fucking junk food\ninto your mouth. Choose rotting away at the end of it all, pissing your\nlast in a miserable home, nothing more than an embarrassment to the\nselfish, fucked up brats you spawned to replace yourselves. Choose your\nfuture. Choose life… But why would I want to do a thing like that? I\nchose not to choose life. I chose somethin’ else. And the reasons? There\nare no reasons. Who needs reasons when you’ve got heroin?\\\n\\\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000191/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Mark “Rent-boy” Renton</a></strong> : We\ntook morphine, diamorphine, cyclizine, codeine, temazepam, nitrazepam,\nphenobarbitone, sodium amytal, dextropropo xyphene, methadone,\nnalbuphine, pethidine, pentazocine, buprenorphine, dextromoramide,\nchlormethiazole.

We’re the lowest of the low. The scum of the\nfucking Earth! The most wretched, miserable, servile, pathetic trash\nthat was ever shat into civilization. Some hate the English. I don’t.\nThey’re just wankers. We, on the other hand, are COLONIZED by wankers.\nCan’t even find a decent culture to be colonized BY. We’re ruled by\neffete assholes. It’s a SHITE state of affairs to be in, Tommy, and ALL\nthe fresh air in the world won’t make any fucking difference!\\\n\\\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000191/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Mark “Rent-boy” Renton</a></strong> : Now\nI’ve justified this to myself in all sorts of ways. It wasn’t a big\ndeal, just a minor betrayal. Or we’d outgrown each other, you know, that\nsort of thing. But let’s face it, I ripped them off - my so called\nmates. But Begbie, I couldn’t give a shit about him. And Sick Boy, well\nhe’d done the same to me, if he’d only thought of it first. And Spud,\nwell okay, I felt sorry for Spud - he never hurt anybody. So why did I\ndo it? I could offer a million answers - all false. The truth is that\nI’m a bad person. But, that’s gonna change - I’m going to change. This\nis the last of that sort of thing. Now I’m cleaning up and I’m moving\non, going straight and choosing life. I’m looking forward to it already.\nI’m gonna be just like you. The job, the family, the fucking big\ntelevision. The washing machine, the car, the compact disc and electric\ntin opener, good health, low cholesterol, dental insurance, mortgage,\nstarter home, leisure wear, luggage, three piece suite, DIY, game shows,\njunk food, children, walks in the park, nine to five, good at golf,\nwashing the car, choice of sweaters, family Christmas, indexed pension,\ntax exemption, clearing gutters, getting by, looking ahead, the day you\ndie.</p>\n<p>Created by X&#x26;Y</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
