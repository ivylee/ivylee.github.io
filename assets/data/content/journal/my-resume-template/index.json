Just arrive, getting used to New York, excited about new life\nand new things to learn.</p>\n<p>LaTeX is very nice for writing structured documents. I used to prepare\nmy resume using <a href=\"http://www.ctan.org/pkg/moderncv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">moderncv</a> . It was\nreally nice, easy and beautiful. But somehow I find it a little bit too\nfancy now. I decided to write my own resume class, no coloring no\npictures just plain and simple. I used LaTeX for my undergraduate thesis\nand I modified thesis templates from other sources to fit my thesis\nformat requirements, but I’ve never build a template from ground up\nmyself. So the resume template, it was good exercise. Now I’m not scared\nof writing LaTeX class files anymore. :)</p>\n<p>Btw it’s\n<a href=\"https://github.com/ivylee/latex/blob/master/my_resume.cls\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</a> .</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
