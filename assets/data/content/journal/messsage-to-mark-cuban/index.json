If u don’t do this asap,\nwith Kidd aging and Nowitzki’s 1 yr left of the contract, the mavs will\nbe no where near the championship for the next 10 yrs. U probably won’t\nread about this but I’ve got to say sth after watching the mavs play the\nkings, it was really disappointing. The mavs coach didn’t even exist.\nAbsolutely no strategy. Pls fire him and get someone smart enough to win\ngames.</p>\n<p>Sincerely a fan</p>\n<p>Created by X&#x26;Y</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
