There are two reasons for this: 1. scarcely any good/positive\nstories are reported or published. 2. bad things happen all the time, on\nmedia and around myself.</p>\n<p>From what I’ve learned such kind of mixture consists of the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>poverty</li>\n<li>lack of education</li>\n<li>inequality of opportunity and distribution</li>\n<li>deprived human rights</li>\n<li>environmental pollution</li>\n<li>contempt of law and order</li>\n<li>natural disaster</li>\n<li>irresponsibility of private enterprises and government</li>\n<li>corruption</li>\n<li>lack of democracy/pseudo-democracy</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Above should cover most of the social problems seen everyday on media.\nPick any piece of news, its cause consists at least one of the above ten\naspects I’ve listed. Apparently it’s not an exhaustive list, there are\nstill many uncommon or peculiar reasons that can’t be categorized, of\nwhy some incidents happen, yet for these kinds of reasons I believe it’s\neasier to identify and deal with. Problems I’ve listed are much harder\nto solve.</p>\n<p>So I ask myself, how can I do sth about it? I have no power, no voice,\nno money, no influence, no nothing. All I can do is to know about it,\nand stop at knowing about it. Does this make my conscience feel better?\nNo. I tend to stop reading such kind of news because they are all the\nsame, identical in structure and the elements I’ve listed above. Then I\ngot accused of being unconcerned about this reality. Is that so?</p>\n<p>As ordinary people many like to read about news happening everyday with\nthe same plot and circulating around colleagues friends or anyone they\nknow, the best result of such action is raising people’s awareness\ntowards these social problems but, I can’t say I’m satisfied with it.\nWhat I’ve been thinking and frustrated about is finding the cure. This\ncountry needs reform from upside down, it needs action, much more than\nmerely talks. And I don’t think once CCP is no longer in control\neverything will definitely be better. To blame everything on one\npolitical party is absolutely wrong. In America does it guarantee a\nbetter future once the democrats substitude the republicans? No. Blaming\neverything on one party is a much too naive idea. The danger side of\nsuch beliefs is it will become a tool for manipulating these believers\nif, somehow, a new party rises up and says, we can replace CCP, we\npromise you this and that, and after that continues to be exactly like\nCCP. To tackle the above listed problems we have to look into each of it\nindividually and as a whole situation. Ideally, changes are made from\nthe smallest to biggest to minimize social cost. I believe reform, if\nit’s going to happen, will be long and hard, and I don’t rule out the\npossibility of revolution, not like some of the moderate optimists.</p>\n<p>It is just absurd, to say I don’t care about reality or this society.</p>\n<p>And it is even absurd, to have a conversation when not both sides are\nobjective and calm. That’s how people get things not done, problems\nunresolved.</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
