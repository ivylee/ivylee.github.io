Shutting down public\ntransportation, stopping schools, gathering food and water. All this,\nseemed unreal until I lost electricity at around 8.30 pm Oct. 29th.</p>\n<p>Few minutes before that, I had my tv turned on, following the news while\nI had dinner. A man in uniform knocked on my door and asked if I had\nopened my windows since there were some strange noise and other\nresidents complained. Of course I didn’t open my windows and I heard the\nnoise too! Fortunately I wasn’t the only one that found the noise\nunpleasant. I grabbed a notice on the door handle regarding the storm as\nhe left.</p>\n<p>Just as I was going to clean up, after a flash everything went dark. Oh,\npower outage hit me.</p>\n<p>Don’t panic.</p>\n<p>I didn’t have my flash light prepared, because I never thought I’d be\nusing it. After a while scrambling over my drawers in the dark, I\nmanaged to find my small carry-around flash light but no batteries. But\nI knew I brought one with me from China. So all I had to do was look\nagain, this time more carefully. Then I found one, and another one. But\ngetting a flash light didn’t help. I could do nothing about the\nelectricity. I went out to the hall way, all the emergency lights on,\nand nobody was there. It was quiet. I guessed nobody panicked, which was\ngreat. Then I came back, wondering what I could do. I dialed the numbers\non the notice and confirmed the whole building was in power outage and\nthere was no news about when it would come back. I looked outside the\nwindow, funny thing was I could see the border of power outage, just\nright across the street. On the left everything was dark, on the right\neverything lit up. And police cars were rushing towards the\nneighbourhood.</p>\n<p>I couldn’t study, which was what I planned for the night. I had to save\nthe laptop battery, it was charged about 100%. I got the Powerbank, also\nfrom China, to charge my phone. I sent msgs with friends and family, did\nthe trash, washed the dishes, showered and flossed before going to bed\nwith sirens and lights outside.</p>\n<p>At 3 am I woke up, it was still noisy. It is always noisy here, sirens\nroaring from 11 pm till midnight all the way through morning. I tried\nthe lamp, still dark anyway. Then I went back to sleep, hoping things\nwould work in the morning.</p>\n<p>Around 8.40 am, I got up and tried the lights, still the same. I still\nhad hot water, everything except electricity. My stove wasn’t working. I\nhad to think about my food. Luckily without planning for emergency, I\nhad bread, milk, orange juice, tomatoes, cucumbers, bananas and green\ngrapes, all of which could be consumed without cooking. But I’d like my\nmilk to be warm. The solution was filling the stockpot with hot tap\nwater and put my mug with milk in. So I had a nice breakfast as usual,\nwarm milk and a banana.</p>\n<p>I dialed the numbers on the notice again, no news for power recovery. I\nhad to figure out what to do for a whole day and worry about getting to\nschool tomorrow if subway service was still suspended. About 6.5 hrs of\nbattery left on my laptop. So I wrote this post and then started reading\nthe textbook to prepare for midterm on Thursday morning.</p>\n<p>Around noon, I noticed water coming out of my tap much more slower than\nusual. Worried that I might run out of it, I saved some using pans and\nanything that seemed to be capable of storing water. About half an hour\nlater, the nightmare happened. No electricity, no water. I couldn’t even\nflush the toilet. One can live without electricity but NOT without\nwater! This was the moment that I really panicked. I needed a place to\nlive! Survive! I had to abandon my apt! I tried to call management\noffice to confirm the water outage, but they didn’t seem to know what\nwas going on.</p>\n<p>I was very lucky. After posting on facebook and a few text msgs, I had\noptions of places to stay. I had been very lucky since I came to New\nYork. Life is an adventure. You’ll never know where it takes you,\nespecially in face of disaster and uncertainty. I’d never thought the\nfollowing days would turn out to be one of the happiest week of my life,\nthe happiest I could be in the shadow of the storm.</p>\n<p>I left my apt in the afternoon of Oct 30th, came back in the morning of\nNov 4th. I might have been the luckiest and happiest refugee. Everything\nlooked intact. All I needed to do was some cleaning, and life went back\nto normal. I did have a secret small wish that I could stay longer as a\nrefugee. But life goes on! And life is better now that I have all those\nwarm and happy memories.</p>\n<p>C’est la vie. C’est ma vie.</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
