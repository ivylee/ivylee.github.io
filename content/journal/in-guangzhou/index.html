<p>Still a bit jet-lagged, I went for my visa interview today and finished within half an hour,
while watching lines of people slowly moving, occasionally one or two arguing with the assistants.
There's so much heat, it makes the people short-tempered.</p>
<p>I took the subway home as I vaguely remember how to get there from this station.
To make sure I studied the map, and found a few more new lines but the way home didn't change.
One stop before the transfer I decided to go out and walk back along the river.
There it is, a new tram! A cute little tram that travels only within a short distance.
Walking on, I discovered plenty of seniors and kids with nannies enjoying their day,
and an open-air ballroom under the bridge where the dancing and the music happen.
It's definitely much more crowded and full of life compared to when I first moved in to this neighborhood,
about 10 years ago.</p>
<p>More than anything else, I miss the food here.
I tried rice noodles with Shantou beef balls in a neighborhood restaurant yesterday with my mother,
it was awesome. I also made sure to eat curry fish balls from 7-11 that I couldn't find in any 7-11 in the US.
The old and trusted restaurants are still around, with plenty of new and upcoming competitors.
But the prices seem to be 20% higher than before.</p>
<p>Banking and mobile services are disappointing, for anyone spoiled by the efficiency of the US.
I spent more than 2 hours in the bank to do something that need not to be done ever in the US.
I visited 3 stores just to find out the prepaid plans I saw online are not available in store,
because of lower margin.</p>
<p>(To be continued...)</p>
