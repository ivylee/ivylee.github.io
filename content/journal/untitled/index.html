Le francais est trés difficile pour moi.\
It was 3 years ago when I graduated from junior high that I started to
learn french. It only lasted a month. Then, 3 years later, now I’ve
graduated from senior high and there’s time for me to continue my study
of french. But unfortunately, what I learned the first day in the french
class was that I had forgotten nearly everything about french except for
the pronounciation. Then I struggled. I couldn’t follow the teacher so I
reviewed the lessons I learnt 3 years ago. I’m glad that I’m getting
through this.\
In classes given by Chinese teacher, it’s mainly about grammar. In
classes given by Maurice Jacque, it’s absolutely french. I find it hard
to follow him word by word though in all, I understand what he means. He
usually wants us to explain some particular words, in french, but all I
could do is to find something similiar from english. I just can’t talk
in french! This is too bad.\
Deux\
Maurice est un grand homme.\
He’s really strong, physically. One thing maybe indicates a little
french of him is he forms a small tail with his hair.\
In the morning today, we should have begun classes around 9 am. But
Maurice was about 20 mins late. He explained that the lock on his door
was broken and he didn’t find out until he was to leave. So he spoke to
those security stuff but nobody understood him. Pauvre Maurice!
Naturally, he extended today’s class by 25 mins to make up for the lost
time.\
Trois\
On n’elle aime pas.\
There’s this around 21-year-old girl in the french class. Her voice is
loud and clear. She’s not afraid of asking questions, no matter smart or
stupid, and she doesn’t care if it’s in the middle of the class. After a
few attempts to break the fluency of the class, which she succeeded
anyway, she annoyed some of the fellow students. For me, she’s too eager
to know the answer to the question that pops up in her mind. In some
cases, Miss Zou had just finished explaining something difficult
thoroughly, this girl asked the same question right the way. She seemed
to be too devoted in making notes that she hadn’t heard any of the
teacher’s words. I can’t say I’m annoyed but I think that was impolite,
pausing the class just to answer your questions, and sometimes, stupid
quesions. She should’ve left those to after-class.\
Then in Maurice’s second class, when Maurice was talking about voyelles
and consonnes or something like that, she demanded Maurice to teach
something more difficult. She thought what we were learning was too easy
and we shoudn’t waste time in those because there were so many lessons
following. Another one or two agreed with her. Maurice asked us to vote
whether we should go faster. I was neutral. She said in a even louder
tone to make other agree with her. Maurice then said seriously, “I want
everybody’s opinion, not your opinion!” I wasn’t sure about the ‘!’ but
it was the loudest tone Maurice had used. Finally, she couldn’t get her
way.\
The next morning, I came back to the classroom, found this
“教室是大家的教室，老师是大家的老师。请某位同学自重，否则，面斥不雅。”
on the blackboard. It was cruel! Other students were also surprised. My
deskmate told me it was written by a ‘teacher’. I couldn’t figure out
whom she meant. There she came. No expressions on her face. She went out
for water, then came back, picked up a piece of chalk, and wrote
“每个人都有表达意见的权利。当面不说，背后议论，毛主席说是小人。” It
became a drama. The peak of emotion had come and gone. After that, there
were much less questions from her during class. Later, I’ve discovered
that she came to class by an old bicycle that resembles my grandpa’s.\
