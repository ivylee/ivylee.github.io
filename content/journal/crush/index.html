just at the school gate. He was coming in and I was going out, chatting
with my friend. At once he captured my eyes. I wasn't so sure if that
was him. I confirmed by taking another glance and  was immediately
attracted by his… I don't know how to describe it. And I looked right on
his face before he realized he was watched by someone. Then he looked at
me, I looked at him. Right at that moment, I knew I was supposed to
greet him but I couldn't say a word. It felt like when I tried the
跳楼机 for the first time, I was so moved by the beautiful scenary I saw
in the sky. I didn't scream and I wished to stay in the sky for as long
as possible. I guess he could have felt something strange about me.\
I think he's the handsomest among the leaders in our school. He was
realistic, and humorous, more of an inside person. I attended his
classes when I was in senior 1. He would come to the classroom early and
play classical music using the laptop before beginning lesson. He would
talk about his hobby including hi-fis and collecting Chinese acient
teapots during class as examples of some economic phenomenon. I enjoyed
pretty much every minute of it.\
Recently I noticed he changed his dressing style. He casually leaves
the bottom part of his shirt out of trousers, unlike most of the
teachers in our school. He looks more comfortable and charming now. I
like this change.\</p>
