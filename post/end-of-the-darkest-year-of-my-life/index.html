		<p>Hope is all I have, for 2009.<br />
 The end is not near, it’s here.<br />
 Reconnected few friends from primary school, one of whom had totally
forgotten me. It was sad, cause after all this time, 7 yrs we didn’t get
in touch in any possible way though we’ve always had each other’s name
on qq. He changed a lot. Each of us had forbidden topics and
conversation could not proceed. Once again, the feeling of distance!<br />
 I hate it. When I went back to HF for the (ridiculous) 120th
Anniversary, I felt like a stranger. My mind kept whispering, ‘I don’t
belong here, I don’t belong here anymore’. This is me, who couldn’t say
a word to many familiar faces, who enjoyed silent company with an old
friend, the one I anxiously wanted to meet, who ran away from the past
as fast as possible.<br />
 Clarified something, still a long way to go.<br />
 First step of preparation.<br />
 Winter break plans- 1st stage.<br />
 Regret: didn’t spend enough time with X-2, including tonight’s outing…<br />
 Hope! Hope! Hope!<br />
 Start fresh!</p>
