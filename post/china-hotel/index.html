		<p>Wow, finally after so much preparation, Rose, Vera and I got to China
Hotel. Entered a building of about ten years old, we took an elevator
also aged about ten, then we walked into a mini conference room. An
officer was expecting us and she went to set up the laptop and projecter
as we asked and another officer came in with 2 cups of water and later
another cup. Just then the first officer, Olivia which she later
introduced herself as, informed us that we should be facing only two
students, herself and the one who gave us water, later known as <em>sorry,
I forgot</em> . We were actually shocked, literally shocked. We didn’t know
what to do, how to teach the whole class of two officers. Based on the
previous communications with Olivia, whom Rose said was a fluent English
speaker, we decided right the way to jump to plan B which is designed
for high level students, of course the testing part was skipped. Olivia
told us that it should be a demo of our class which should last no more
than 35 mins, so we cut and cut and cut all the discussions and gave
them the main structure. At first I was nervous but after I did my part
of introduction during which I made a little interaction with the 2
students, I started to get on track. But I felt I was uneasy compared to
Rose and Vera. They tried their best to explain the structure of the
speech and useful phrases and I was supporting the falling writing
paper. Surprisingly what interested them most was relaxation in the
middle of the class. So we went through it smoothly.<br />
 After the class was over, we had a little meeting with the 2 officers.
They pointed out that we spoke too fast, that we should take students’
English level into account and we should focus more on the common use of
the phrases. Oh no! We assumed they were high level students at the very
beginning! It was the major problem, other than that, I thought we were
fine. After everything was settled, we left for 007.<br />
 Going to TeeMall(?) with Rose and Vera was great fun. We first bought
the movie tickets, then seperated to look for food, at last waited at
the cinema entrance. Just then I realized I had lost the ticket, three
of us looking up and down, inside out of my bag and my pockets but it
was fruitless. So I sent them in and went out looking for that little
piece of paper. I remembered my route but couldn’t find it. At last I
went to the entrance and asked if I could get in. The lady said I should
ask the sales window but when I got there, the miss said they had
shifted and the person who sold me the ticket was gone and she couldn’t
make a decision. I raised my voice and she told me to go to the office.
In the office, I repeated everything and a man lead me in. Haha, finally
I got in. Worth mentioning that I didn’t provide any prove that I had
paid for my ticket and my friends were in the cinema.<br />
 The movie was boring, I still think Daniel Criag is too short. We went
window shopping afterwards. It was exciting, all girl stuff. Trying
shoes and make-ups and perfumes…<br />
 I was planning to watch my friend modeling at the welcome-freshmen
party hosted in her university but instead I came to TeeMall. Luckily,
the show was broken in by the unexpected shower and I got to do that
another time!<br />
 It was crazy and we got in the subway only to hear the broadcast saying
Line 4 had stopped service. I was so near home that I decided to go home
and Rose and Vera together were to catch the last bus back to U. A brief
fairwell, I was at home.</p>
