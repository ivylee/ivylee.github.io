		<p>After almost 11 hours in the library, here comes almost 27 hours in the
dorm, with 0.5 hour going out for food.<br />
 Today I had 13 hours of sleep, then the rest of the day was filled with
net surfing and music. Didn’t begin working until 8 pm.<br />
 I learned today that John Lennon said “Time you enjoy wasting, was not
wasted.”. This gave myself a justification for not doing anything
related to work or study.<br />
 Tomorrow I shall go out, breathe the air and start fresh. But I don’t
see myself sitting in the library in the next couple days.<br />
 The good thing about staying at school on weekends is that I can sleep
for as long as I desire without being disturbed by my grandparents or
parents or construction workers. The bad thing is that I’ve got to look
for food myself and it takes me a long time to decide whether to eat sth
or not. I hope I could skip all my meals but my stomach protested. I
came to believe being hungry is better than being full so I ate little.
Is it also the effect of the night spent in the library?</p>
