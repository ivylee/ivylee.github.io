<h5 id="mini-biography-1">Mini Biography</h5>

<p>Christopher Eccleston trained at the Central School of Speech and Drama
and first came to public attention as Derek Bentley in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102288/">Let Him Have
It</a> (1991). However, it was a
regular role in the TV series
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105977/">&ldquo;Cracker&rdquo;</a> (1993) that made him a
recognizable figure in the UK. He appeared in the low-budget thriller
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111149/">Shallow Grave</a> (1995) and in the
same year won the part of Nicky Hutchinson in the epic BBC drama serial
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115305/">&ldquo;Our Friends in the North&rdquo;</a>
(1996). It was the transmission of the latter series on BBC Two that
really made him into a household name in the UK.<br />
<br />
 In his film career he has starred as a leading man alongside a number
of major actresses, such as <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000250/">Renée
Zellweger</a> in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120793/">A Price Above
Rubies</a> (1998), <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000949/">Cate
Blanchett</a> in
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0127536/">Elizabeth</a> (1998), and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000139/">Cameron
Diaz</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0108287/">Jordana
Brewster</a> in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0178642/">The Invisible
Circus</a> (2001), and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000173/">Nicole
Kidman</a> in &ldquo;The Others&rdquo;.<br />
<br />
 In addition to his successful film career, he has continued to work in
his favourite medium, appearing in some of the most challenging and
thought-provoking British television dramas of recent years. These have
included <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0243183/">&ldquo;Clocking Off&rdquo;</a> (2000)
and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0345239/">Flesh and Blood</a> (2002) (TV)
for the BBC and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116533/">Hillsborough</a>
(1996) (TV), the Iago character in a modern adaptation of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Othello&rdquo;, and the religious epic <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0353104/">The Second
Coming</a> (2003) (TV), playing Steve
Baxter, the son of God.<br />
<br />
 His stage career, while not as extensive as his screen credits, has
nevertheless shown him to be a formidable actor. He&rsquo;s given intense,
focused performances in such plays as &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo;, &ldquo;Electricity&rdquo; and &ldquo;Miss
Julie&rdquo;, for which he received excellent reviews.<br />
<br />
 A very highly regarded actor, Eccleston has twice been nominated in the
Best Actor category at the BAFTA Television
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/SearchBios?Award">Award</a> s, the UK&rsquo;s premiere TV
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/SearchBios?award">award</a> s ceremony. His first
nomination came in 1997 for &ldquo;Our Friends in the North&rdquo;. Although he
didn&rsquo;t win those <a href="http://www.imdb.com/SearchBios?award">award</a> s, he
did, however, triumph in the Best Actor categories at the 1997
Broadcasting Press Guild <a href="http://www.imdb.com/SearchBios?Award">Award</a> s
and the Royal Television Society
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/SearchBios?Award">Award</a> s, winning for &ldquo;Our
Friends in the North&rdquo;. He won the RTS Best Actor
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/SearchBios?award">award</a> for a second time in 2003,
this time for his performance in &ldquo;Flesh and Blood&rdquo;. In 2005 he received
the Most Popular Actor <a href="http://www.imdb.com/SearchBios?award">award</a> in
the National Television <a href="http://www.imdb.com/SearchBios?Award">Award</a> s
for Doctor Who.</p>

<h5 id="personal-quotes">Personal Quotes</h5>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t always such a great fan of Shakespeare, mind you. I can guess
we all at one time had it rammed down our necks at school, which tends
to take the edge off it.</p>

<p>A year later, and I&rsquo;m average again.</p>

<p>Any horror element is as much psychological as special effects.</p>

<p>Culturally we&rsquo;ve always felt it important to express the life of the
count ry, and working class comes into that.</p>

<p>I came out of school in &lsquo;79 when unemployment was really starting to
bite, went back and redid my O-levels, there was a play going on and I
was corralled into it.</p>

<p>I care more about telly because it made me an actor and there&rsquo;s a much
more immediate response to TV. You can address the political or cultural
fabric of your country.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m different from the other Doctors in that I&rsquo;m northern. All the
others spoke with this RP accent [received pronunciation] - maybe it was
that that put me off. I think that it&rsquo;s good that we teach kids that
people who speak like that can be heroic. (On starring in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0436992/">&ldquo;Doctor
Who&rdquo;</a> (2005))</p>

<p>My bony face is like a car crash. I haven&rsquo;t got good looks, just weird
looks, enough to frighten the fiercest monster.</p>

<p></p>
