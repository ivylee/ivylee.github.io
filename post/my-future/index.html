		<p>I struggled. I fought.<br />
 I wanted to be a doctor. I see learning to be a doctor a great
challenge to myself. But no one in my family supported this idea. They
thought I was idealistic and would soon lose interest. And they tried to
talk me out of it by describing poor working conditions and painful
faces of patients. Frankly I didn’t consider that much. I just wanted to
get an M.D. and then throw myself into volunteering work, to help people
who need help. How can that be difficult?<br />
 I gave up.<br />
 After all the work my father had done, I still couldn’t be admitted by
the university I desired. Then my dream collapsed. I would never be able
to achieve that. I gave in to reality. I comfort myself that to be an
actuary is also challenging and I could earn great money from this
career. My whole family seemed happy and content, they even thought my
failure to pursue medicine is destined. I was extremely desperate but I
can only tell them to fuck off in my mind. What a coward I am!<br />
 I must<br />
 earn a lot of money. Then take some time off to pursue medicine. Then
move to Ireland and build a seaside glass house. Nothing could stop me.</p>
