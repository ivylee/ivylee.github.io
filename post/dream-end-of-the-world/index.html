		<p>last night i had a weird dream. it was dark, midnight i guess. there was
a huge boat (yeah maybe the so called noah’s ark), and people were
expanding a huge fishing net in the dark water. i didn’t know what was
it for but i clearly had the notion that this was the end, the end of
days. then a question popped up: when the day comes, who will be in ur
arms? nobody. i was all alone, quiet and by myself. and then fear just
overcame me. i panicked and regained my conscience.</p>

<p>actuallly initially when i heard the story of 2012, or the noah’s ark, i
wasn’t worried at all. instead i wanted it to be true so i could just
hop on a plane and fly to be with the one i love without the burden of
any consequences. after all i want to die next to someone i love. better
yet i could withdraw everything in my bank account and go travelling
around the world, see everything before i die, before everything dies.</p>

<p>of course i know the story is fake. and now i don’t have any one i
particularly love. so there’s only fear and panic left.</p>

<p>when the day comes, who will be in ur arms?</p>
