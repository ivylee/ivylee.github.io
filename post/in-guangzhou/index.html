		<p>So I&rsquo;m back after spending the last 3 years in the US.</p>

<p>Still a bit jet-lagged, I went for my visa interview today and finished within half an hour,
while watching lines of people slowly moving, occasionally one or two arguing with the assistants.
There&rsquo;s so much heat, it makes the people short-tempered.</p>

<p>I took the subway home as I vaguely remember how to get there from this station.
To make sure I studied the map, and found a few more new lines but the way home didn&rsquo;t change.
One stop before the transfer I decided to go out and walk back along the river.
There it is, a new tram! A cute little tram that travels only within a short distance.
Walking on, I discovered plenty of seniors and kids with nannies enjoying their day,
and an open-air ballroom under the bridge where the dancing and the music happen.
It&rsquo;s definitely much more crowded and full of life compared to when I first moved in to this neighborhood,
about 10 years ago.</p>

<p>More than anything else, I miss the food here.
I tried rice noodles with Shantou beef balls in a neighborhood restaurant yesterday with my mother,
it was awesome. I also made sure to eat curry fish balls from 7-11 that I couldn&rsquo;t find in any 7-11 in the US.
The old and trusted restaurants are still around, with plenty of new and upcoming competitors.
But the prices seem to be 20% higher than before.</p>

<p>Banking and mobile services are disappointing, for anyone spoiled by the efficiency of the US.
I spent more than 2 hours in the bank to do something that need not to be done ever in the US.
I visited 3 stores just to find out the prepaid plans I saw online are not available in store,
because of lower margin.</p>

<p>(To be continued&hellip;)</p>
