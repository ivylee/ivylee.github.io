      <p>Distance. I’ve foreseen this problem and I’ve felt it. I cannot say it’s
strong but it exists. Time brings it between me and the others. I just
can’t be like before. I honestly don’t know what to say. Maybe I love to
isolate myself. I’m cool with not being a big talker. Don’t know if this
is natural but I guess it is, at least for me. Some of them noticed that
I’m different, quite beyond their expectation I guess. But I thought
changes were good things. How can someone not change after all these
years? In all, I felt like going further and further away from my past.
I always run away from my past. There’s always something I don’t want to
remember or think about. I need to go to a place where no one knows me.
Run away. That’s what I do. Does it make me a coward?</p>
