 Recently I’ve read this post from Afterelton then I started to watch
some gay-themed films. Last night my mum found out I was watching
Beautiful Thing then she told me not to watch ‘this kind of thing’ in a
weird tone. She despised it clearly. That’s her, the most conservative
person I know.<br />
 I don’t see gay a problem. They are just different. The tagline of
Brokeback Mountain tells the truth-love is a force of nature. I should
say I feel the love between gay people is more tender, exquisite and
smooth. It’s a beautiful thing indeed. How come so many people think
it’s sick? Please stop doing this. Everyone deserves to love and to be
love, equally.</p>
