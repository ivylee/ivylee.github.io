		<p><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000191/">Mark “Rent-boy” Renton</a></strong> : [
<em>narrating</em> ] Choose Life. Choose a job. Choose a career. Choose a
family. Choose a fucking big television, choose washing machines, cars,
compact disc players and electrical tin openers. Choose good health, low
cholesterol, and dental insurance. Choose fixed interest mortgage
repayments. Choose a starter home. Choose your friends. Choose
leisurewear and matching luggage. Choose a three-piece suite on hire
purchase in a range of fucking fabrics. Choose DIY and wondering who the
fuck you are on Sunday morning. Choose sitting on that couch watching
mind-numbing, spirit-crushing game shows, stuffing fucking junk food
into your mouth. Choose rotting away at the end of it all, pissing your
last in a miserable home, nothing more than an embarrassment to the
selfish, fucked up brats you spawned to replace yourselves. Choose your
future. Choose life… But why would I want to do a thing like that? I
chose not to choose life. I chose somethin’ else. And the reasons? There
are no reasons. Who needs reasons when you’ve got heroin?<br />
<br />
 <strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000191/">Mark “Rent-boy” Renton</a></strong> : We
took morphine, diamorphine, cyclizine, codeine, temazepam, nitrazepam,
phenobarbitone, sodium amytal, dextropropo xyphene, methadone,
nalbuphine, pethidine, pentazocine, buprenorphine, dextromoramide,
chlormethiazole. The streets are awash with drugs you can have.<br />
<br />
 <strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0571727/">Tommy</a></strong> : Doesn’t it make you
proud to be Scottish?<br />
 <strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000191/">Mark “Rent-boy” Renton</a></strong> :
It’s SHITE being Scottish! We’re the lowest of the low. The scum of the
fucking Earth! The most wretched, miserable, servile, pathetic trash
that was ever shat into civilization. Some hate the English. I don’t.
They’re just wankers. We, on the other hand, are COLONIZED by wankers.
Can’t even find a decent culture to be colonized BY. We’re ruled by
effete assholes. It’s a SHITE state of affairs to be in, Tommy, and ALL
the fresh air in the world won’t make any fucking difference!<br />
<br />
 <strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000191/">Mark “Rent-boy” Renton</a></strong> : Now
I’ve justified this to myself in all sorts of ways. It wasn’t a big
deal, just a minor betrayal. Or we’d outgrown each other, you know, that
sort of thing. But let’s face it, I ripped them off - my so called
mates. But Begbie, I couldn’t give a shit about him. And Sick Boy, well
he’d done the same to me, if he’d only thought of it first. And Spud,
well okay, I felt sorry for Spud - he never hurt anybody. So why did I
do it? I could offer a million answers - all false. The truth is that
I’m a bad person. But, that’s gonna change - I’m going to change. This
is the last of that sort of thing. Now I’m cleaning up and I’m moving
on, going straight and choosing life. I’m looking forward to it already.
I’m gonna be just like you. The job, the family, the fucking big
television. The washing machine, the car, the compact disc and electric
tin opener, good health, low cholesterol, dental insurance, mortgage,
starter home, leisure wear, luggage, three piece suite, DIY, game shows,
junk food, children, walks in the park, nine to five, good at golf,
washing the car, choice of sweaters, family Christmas, indexed pension,
tax exemption, clearing gutters, getting by, looking ahead, the day you
die.</p>
