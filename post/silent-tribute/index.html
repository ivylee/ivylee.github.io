    <div class="content">
      <p>Today, at 14:28 in the school stadium, I stood in silent tribute along
with all the staff and students for 3 minutes.<br />
 Our head master sobbed during his speech on the disastrous earthquake
happened in Sichuan Province a week ago, when he spoke of the children
there not being able to fulfill their dreams of getting quality
education. He also expressed gratitude to everyone who cares and helps
the suffering people in Sichuan. The donation of our school’s staff
reached 20,000 yuan, not including a donation of 50,000 yuan from a
student’s parents which arrived today.<br />
 On my way back home, the bus tv was reporting the updates on the rescue
work. I was particularly moved by a young doctor. All of his family
members were taken by the earthquake when they were on vacation. But the
doctor take no time mourning for the death, instead he came to Sichuan
from Guangdong to join the rescue work and has already saved 27 people,
3 times as many as his dead family members. During the interview, his
was surprisingly calm and professional and I thought this is the kind of
person I want to be, professional volunteers.<br />
 The sudden earthquake brought the people of China the strongest will to
survive and the warmest help of all kinds.</p>
