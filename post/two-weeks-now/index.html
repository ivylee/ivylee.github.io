    <div class="content">
      <p>2 weeks after I became a Senior 2 student, I found myself not got along
with my new classmates very well. It seemed everyone just trying to grab
their old familiar friends instead of trying to make new acquaintances.
As I understand the situation, I think making new friends while we
maintain old friendships is necessary. After all, we have to be with new
classmates for the next 2 years. How can we not be known to each other?<br />
 About the teachers, I found something very interesting. Facts about
teachers are often talked by students, especially facts beside he/she as
a teacher. My new math teacher, L, is fond of music and he’s good at
composing. I remembered once when I entered the office, he was singing
Chinese opera while working which really surprised me. There are many
other things about a teacher that we talked about. And through the
talking, little things will spread quickly until they are known to some
certain number of people. They are not like rumors, but sort of news
from the tabloids. Actually no one knows where the information came from
or it’s true or not. But curiosity drove us to the joy of revealing some
mystery.<br />
 About my former math teacher: on 31st Aug. he was said to be the class
teacher of Senior 2 Class 5; on 2nd Sept. he was not in the Senior 2
office; later he was said to be teaching Senior 1 and not much later he
was said to be teaching a junior class and Senior 1; the latest news is
that he is teaching Senior 1 Class 2&amp;5 and is the classteacher of Senior
1 Class 2.<br />
 Interesting.</p>
