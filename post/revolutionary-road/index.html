      <p>A friend said she didn’t quite understand the movie. I didn’t feel that
way. When April suggested they go to Paris, for me, it was déja vu.
Frank, working as an ordinary officer for Knox(?), didn’t get any
meaning from his work. He was a man without passion, without life.
April, who studied acting to be an actress when she was young, buried
her dream in daily routines as a housewife. April couldn’t endure the
emptiness anymore, so she persuaded Frank to move to Paris where she’d
support him by working as a secretary while he could take the time to
explore his real interests, what he inwardly desired to do. At first,
they were thrilled by the plan, but their neighbors and Frank’s
co-workers made no sense of why they were giving up their life on
Revolutionary Road. Only John, an insane ex-Mathamatician, understood
their dream to live, to thrive again. Unexpectedly, Frank got a
promotion and April got pregnant. April was determined to leave, ready
for abortion but Frank, who wouldn’t give up his opportunity and his
child, had second thoughts. They had a hard fight, then everything went
on as Frank wished. Only John saw the truth, the selfishness of Frank.
On the last morning, it seemed that April was getting back on track,
cooking breakfast for Frank. At that very moment, I can see April’s
dying, I just can tell. Then I think about the baby, April might kill
him/her first then commit suicide. So I waited and everything went on as
expected, except that I thought maybe, April wasn’t supposed to die from
blood lost, which was an accident of her abortion. No one, including
Frank, really understood April’s death. From April’s point of view, I
relived my life, the very few days just after I found out where I got
admitted. It was hell and I tried to run away from it. I told myself I
would not accept that and I wouldn’t go there, that wasn’t the life, the
destination I was looking for. So I went online and searched for foreign
universities. I was determined to go to St Petersburg for the study of
medicine and I emailed to the admission office asking about details.
Then, after a mental breakdown, I surrendered, to reality. I’m a coward,
compared to April. But I know that, April was different, much more
desperate than I was. I was still young, having the power to change my
future. However she was in a dead end, she could never get out again.
She used to have dreams of becoming an actress, then marriage, children,
so much boundary made her feel that she had lost identity. From a
promising young girl with dream and passion, to one of millions of
housewives. Special to ordinary, passion to emptiness, life to death.
Frank didn’t know what she wanted and their communication was broken.
John was the only one who comprehend her feelings but could do nothing
to help. People who couldn’t understand the movie are those lucky ones
who have never been through desperate situations where one is stuck in
darkness, helpless and hopeless. Did I have to courage to die? No. I
fear death because there are so many things on earth I want to try. I
don’t know if I can do them all but as long as I live, there’s hope for
me. But if I were in the state where April was in, I’d choose to leave
Revolutionary Road and start over. April was too brave.</p>
