		<p>i guess now my temperature reaches 38 point something, not sure because
i don’t have a thermometer…</p>

<p>honestly i don’t remember the last time i wrote something here. it has
been exhausting lately and i couldn’t sleep last night which i guess
caused today’s fever. bad news is that i might still have to go to
classes starting at 8.30 tomorrow….sh!t…</p>

<p>sometimes i look at things i’ve done and blame myself for having done
any of them. i could spend those precious time on studying, reading,
music, movie…anything i love and don’t have enough time to do. but i did
what i’ve done out of enthusiasm too. perplexing thing is i don’t know
what should take up more of my time. volunteering is the one thing so
far i’ve not discover anything ugly inside. you just go out there and
give whatever you can give. it’s a pure joy of giving. but on the other
hand, time’s running out. i’ve got homework and lots of study to work
on. in this U, you are hardly recognized being a volunteer but you get
the scholarship(absolutely not the American version of scholarship) with
your grades, your great effort to climb up in the bureacratic system of
the League or student union, your participation in tedious competitions
and your full attendence of the brain-wash Marxism classes. you must go
with the flow or you’ll be drown. i want to be truthful both to myself
and to anyone else. i don’t flatter and don’t like to be flattered.
there’s nothing i can do to change my surroudings but i won’t
compromise. i will no doubt continue to do what i love and when i leave
this place, i can say to myself, i’ve utilized my time though it may not
seem so in everyone else’s eyes.</p>

<p>i’ve decided to stay in tomorrow.</p>
