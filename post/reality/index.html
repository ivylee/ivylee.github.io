		<p>Last night I was accused of not concerned about reality.</p>

<p>The reality of China, as far as I know, is a mixture of all sorts of
trash. There are two reasons for this: 1. scarcely any good/positive
stories are reported or published. 2. bad things happen all the time, on
media and around myself.</p>

<p>From what I’ve learned such kind of mixture consists of the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>poverty</li>
<li>lack of education</li>
<li>inequality of opportunity and distribution</li>
<li>deprived human rights</li>
<li>environmental pollution</li>
<li>contempt of law and order</li>
<li>natural disaster</li>
<li>irresponsibility of private enterprises and government</li>
<li>corruption</li>
<li>lack of democracy/pseudo-democracy</li>
</ol>

<p>Above should cover most of the social problems seen everyday on media.
Pick any piece of news, its cause consists at least one of the above ten
aspects I’ve listed. Apparently it’s not an exhaustive list, there are
still many uncommon or peculiar reasons that can’t be categorized, of
why some incidents happen, yet for these kinds of reasons I believe it’s
easier to identify and deal with. Problems I’ve listed are much harder
to solve.</p>

<p>So I ask myself, how can I do sth about it? I have no power, no voice,
no money, no influence, no nothing. All I can do is to know about it,
and stop at knowing about it. Does this make my conscience feel better?
No. I tend to stop reading such kind of news because they are all the
same, identical in structure and the elements I’ve listed above. Then I
got accused of being unconcerned about this reality. Is that so?</p>

<p>As ordinary people many like to read about news happening everyday with
the same plot and circulating around colleagues friends or anyone they
know, the best result of such action is raising people’s awareness
towards these social problems but, I can’t say I’m satisfied with it.
What I’ve been thinking and frustrated about is finding the cure. This
country needs reform from upside down, it needs action, much more than
merely talks. And I don’t think once CCP is no longer in control
everything will definitely be better. To blame everything on one
political party is absolutely wrong. In America does it guarantee a
better future once the democrats substitude the republicans? No. Blaming
everything on one party is a much too naive idea. The danger side of
such beliefs is it will become a tool for manipulating these believers
if, somehow, a new party rises up and says, we can replace CCP, we
promise you this and that, and after that continues to be exactly like
CCP. To tackle the above listed problems we have to look into each of it
individually and as a whole situation. Ideally, changes are made from
the smallest to biggest to minimize social cost. I believe reform, if
it’s going to happen, will be long and hard, and I don’t rule out the
possibility of revolution, not like some of the moderate optimists.</p>

<p>It is just absurd, to say I don’t care about reality or this society.</p>

<p>And it is even absurd, to have a conversation when not both sides are
objective and calm. That’s how people get things not done, problems
unresolved.</p>
