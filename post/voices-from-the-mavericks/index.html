		<p>2008 Playoffs first round after Game 3 victory vs.Hornets<br />
<br />
 “I’m waiting for the series to really get going,” Mavs coach Avery
Johnson said, “and hopefully keep improving for our guys.”</p>

<p>“The energy was great in the building for us,” said Nowitzki, who scored
a game-high 32. “The fans got us hyped early.”</p>

<p>“Our defense was a lot better. We were scrambling, going after loose
balls and once we got the rebound, [Jason] Kidd was off to the races.”</p>

<p>“We weren’t going to come out of the locker room and shoot five jump
shots,” Johnson said of the team’s aggressiveness.</p>
