<div class="post-line"></div>

		

		<p>only few months ago, I found out this incredible irc client Irssi,
mainly because huntxu urged me to join some irc channels while pidgin
kept crashing for reasons unknown even though it has been
re-re-recompiled… now irssi is replacing pidgin.</p>

<p>first, what Irssi can do?</p>

<p>it’s an irc client obviously. but it’s more.
<a href="http://www.bitlbee.org/main.php/news.r.html" title="bitlbee">bitlbee</a> added
support for jabber, msn, and many other protocols, which is why irssi
can almost replace pidgin.</p>

<p>another reason why irssi is awesome is the perl scripts. there are many
<a href="http://scripts.irssi.org/" title="irssi script">here</a> .  for now i’m only
using a few, but that’s enough for me.</p>

<p>configuring irssi is easy, just a few words the first time you start the
channels and you’re auto-joined ‘for the rest of your life’. loading
scripts are also simple. no wonder i can handle it. make typing ‘/help’
a habit whenever you encountered any problems or loading a new script.</p>

<p>some would recommend using irssi with screen. well, so far i couldn’t
see the benefit of it, for i’m not much of a coder and occasionally, i
need to refer to manpage while writing something, screen can’t provide a
dual view…</p>

<p>if you’re interested in my irssi configs, pls checkout  my github for
irssi. (just click the big github picture on the right and you’ll see)</p>

<p>for pidgin,</p>

<p>it supports more protocols with plugins which i don’t need. it supports
msn protocol but sometimes just doesn’t work. it supports fetion which
may be the cause of crashes. it supports file transfer but i only
exchange small files with huntxu. and it’s absolutely much larger than
irssi.</p>

<p>arch linux+awesome+irssi: keep it simple and stupid.</p>
