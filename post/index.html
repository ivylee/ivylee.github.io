      <div class="content">
        For the past few months, I have enjoyed using Visdom and Hyperdash to monitor training processes.
Visdom Visom is a Python library developed by Facebook Research. Similar to Tensorboard, it provides a UI server (using React) through which user can create scatter plots, histograms, visualize images and text.
I have written a small snippet for creating and updating a scatter plot, which can be used for visualizing training and validation loss and accuracy.

      <div class="content">
        Training a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) can be a lengthy process. We usually want to monitor training loss and accuracy and validation loss and accuracy by plotting how these metrics change as the number of minibatches grows on a graph. Tensorflow provides Tensorboard for visualizing training progress. Recently I have been playing with PyTorch, I really like its expresiveness and flexibility. Here&rsquo;s a strategy for visualizing training progress with any learning framework that doesn&rsquo;t provide Tensorboard-equivalent feature out of the box using Python 3.

        So I&rsquo;m back after spending the last 3 years in the US.
Still a bit jet-lagged, I went for my visa interview today and finished within half an hour, while watching lines of people slowly moving, occasionally one or two arguing with the assistants. There&rsquo;s so much heat, it makes the people short-tempered.
I took the subway home as I vaguely remember how to get there from this station. To make sure I studied the map, and found a few more new lines but the way home didn&rsquo;t change.

 download the latest Ghost zip bundle unzip cd into the unzipped directory rm -rf content copy config.js and content from previous version Ghost directory to here npm install &ndash;production npm start :)  Let&rsquo;s hope buster still works&hellip;

        It is hot. Cut it using a fork, instead of fixing it with your fingers.
We were cooking vegetables with tofu yesterday. As usual Julio likes to add a Jalapeño into the mix. I cut it the way I cut other vegetables, using my fingers to fix it while cutting it with a knife. About 5 minutes later, I started to feel very hot in my nails. I went to the bathroom to wash my hands with soap, and accidentally touched my nostrils with my fingers.

        I want to write again.
But first I needed to migrate my blog from Octopress to Ghost. I was happy with Octopress until I discovered every update/push took forever because I have 200+ posts.
Migration was not easy. Took me almost 4 nights. Essentially the problems for me were:
I didn&rsquo;t push the markdown files that are supposed to be under source/_posts to github. So I only have a bunch of published html files waiting to be converted back to markdown.

      <div class="content">
        Today I took a taste of Parallel Programming course from CS dept, expecting it to be about achieving parallelization using a low-level language like C/C++ with intensive knowledge on computer theory etc., however it turned out to be lectured by a researcher at IBM who introduced a language, X10, built on top of Java, with functional programming concept as in Scala. As X10 focuses on concurrency there’s new types and ‘struct’ as in C/C++.

        It is probably the best advice given to human race.
At first, it seemed the city was overreacting. Shutting down public transportation, stopping schools, gathering food and water. All this, seemed unreal until I lost electricity at around 8.30 pm Oct. 29th.
Few minutes before that, I had my tv turned on, following the news while I had dinner. A man in uniform knocked on my door and asked if I had opened my windows since there were some strange noise and other residents complained.

        I’m taking two courses that use SAS this semester because SAS is rather widely used in industry. But it’s expensive and few students taking the same classes ever talked about buying the licence. So I have to use SAS on unix server, and this is rather painful experience.
 SSH into unix server is not a problem, but Kerberos authentication keeps asking for password whenever a connection is made, which means when SSH into the unix server and exchanging files between remote and local.
