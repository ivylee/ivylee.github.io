    <div class="content">
      <p>Yesterday around 8.30 pm, I was already sitting on the sofa waiting for
the Wimbledon men’s final between Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer. I
hoped Nadal could win to stop Federer’s winning streak on grass and take
away the trophy Federer had possessed for the last five years.</p>

<hr />

<p></p>

<p>Wimbledon has a new king. Rafael Nadal dethroned Roger Federer after a
five-year reign by winning the longest-ever Wimbledon men’s final.</p>

<p>The consistently heartstopping 6-4, 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 6-7 (8-10), 9-7
classic began at 2.35pm and thanks to a couple of breaks for rain
(surely necessary for the spectators to catch their breath), it ended at
9.15pm with the 22-year-old from Mallorca dropping to the ground with
his arms outstretched in celebration.</p>

<p>Watching the four hours and 48 minutes on-court action, from the vantage
point of the royal box, was Centre Court legend Bjorn Borg. Nadal had
matched the Swede’s fantastic feat of winning the Grand Slams of Roland
Garros and Wimbledon back-to-back and had also prevented Federer
surpassing the five titles in a row he collected between 1976 and 1980.<br />
<br />
 Conditions for the latest duel between tennis’s two finest players
could not have been more demanding. The rain, which delayed the start
for 27 minutes, eventually cleared but the chill, gusting wind which
accompanied it persisted throughout the match, blowing winning shots off
course and making life even more difficult for the two competitors. That
they coped so well spoke volumes for their skill and adaptability.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 With the five-time champion looking less than his authoritative best,
it was Nadal who struck the first heavy blow, capitalising on successive
Federer errors to break for a 2-1 lead.<br />
<br />
 From the start Nadal concentrated his battering-ram attack on the
Federer backhand, aiming every serve and looping forehand in that
direction and it kept the champion in an unaccustomed position - on the
back foot. Federer prospered more when he switched to net-rushing but he
could not block Nadal’s inexorable advance towards the first set.<br />
<br />
 The Spaniard managed to fight off a break point to stay 3-1 ahead and
he needed to avert two more as he served for the set, which he clinched
on his third set point after 48 minutes, courtesy of another brace of
ground stroke errors from Federer.<br />
<br />
 It was the first set Federer had dropped since the final of the French
Open, when he was routed by the same Nadal.<br />
<br />
 Federer’s counter-attack was immediate and it rushed him into a
three-game lead which he extended to an apparently commanding 4-1 with
his sixth and seventh aces, only for the irrepressible Nadal to bounce
back with some thrilling, all-action stuff.<br />
<br />
 To Federer’s visible anger, his serve was broken as a stretched volley
flew out of play and Nadal pulled level at 4-4 as Federer squandered yet
another break point.<br />
<br />
 Now Nadal was in full, thrilling flow, breaking Federer again to lead
5-4 with another huge forehand and celebrating with pumped fists. As he
was serving for the second set, Nadal received a warning from umpire
Pascal Maria of France for taking too long between serves.<br />
<br />
 Clearly unsettled by the timing of that censure, the Spaniard permitted
Federer another break point on a wind-caused error, but in typical
fashion dug deep and clinched the set when Federer once more mistimed a
backhand into the netting. So, having swept five games, Nadal was in the
driving set, two sets ahead.<br />
<br />
 Nadal’s authority suffered a scare in the third game of the third set
when he slipped in making a sudden change of direction and called in the
trainer to check on his right knee. No time-out was requested by Nadal,
though his speed around court appeared to be affected for a while.</p>

<p>He was at full stretch in the next game, fighting off two Federer break
points and, as dark clouds began to mass over Centre Court, the champion
went flat out to recover a set and get back into the match. But four
more break points went begging as Nadal held for 3-3 before wasting
three break points of his own which would have put him 4-3 ahead and
perfectly positioned to win.<br />
<br />
 Instead, with Federer leading 5-4, the expected downpour set in and
play was held up for one hour 20 minutes. On the resumption it was
Federer who dominated when a tie-break was needed to resolve the set,
hammering four aces to take it by seven points to five.<br />
<br />
 The fourth set did not contain a single break point for either man and
when the second tie-break of the match arrived it was a sensation, with
Nadal first leading by five points to two and then reaching, and
missing, two Championship points before Federer levelled at two sets all
when a Nadal backhand error left him the winner by 10 points to eight.<br />
<br />
 Another downpour drove the players off court for half an hour with the
score at 2-2 in the final set and when they returned the light was
fading. But the spirit of both finalists burned bright as they hammered
the ball at each other just as eagerly as they had done when this
marathon first began.<br />
<br />
 At 3-4 Nadal saved a break point which would have left Federer serving
for the title. At 6-6 Federer saved a couple of break points. Finally,
in the gloom, the Spaniard broke to lead 8-7 when Federer struck a
forehand too long.<br />
<br />
 So Nadal served for the match again, getting to his third Championship
point only for Federer to hit an incredible backhand service return.
Deuce once again, but Nadal moved to his fourth match point with a big
serve and, with the crowd going wild, Federer finally cracked, dumping a
forehand in the net.</p>

<p>It was late, very late, but not too late for the coronation of a new
king to begin.<br />
