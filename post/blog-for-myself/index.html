		<p>Never wanted everyone to read my blog. I write for myself. I put other
blog links here just for convenience so I just open my own blog and
click through sth I might be interested in.<br />
 Sometimes I read friends’ blog for a whole afternoon, never knew why
and how they can put so much into words. Maybe it’s the way I think,
that is different from others.<br />
 And, I’m perfectly capable of being alone. I enjoy solitary. Guessed
I’m too independent, too cold maybe?<br />
 Next week will be all about X’mas, too busy to prepare for exams. I
hate the thought that I have to be the best. I shall be satisfied by
just passing all.<br />
 Damn, it’s a difficult task. Just hang on!</p>
