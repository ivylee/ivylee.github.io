		<p><em>this post may be harsh. please remain calm and objective.</em></p>

<p>as i was texting with @Yunkwan about why i don’t particularly like
near-sighted people, i realized there are many aspects about individuals
can be concluded as genetic disadvantages. why?</p>

<p>for example, if one is near-sighted, we may conclude the direct cause
for being near-sighted is one’s inability to maintain a good habit to
protect one’s eyesight, or/as well as the indirect cause, either or both
one’s parents are near-sighted. with either or both causes, one is
near-sighted so now is with a genetic disadvantage. note this is because
statistics show that parents’ eyesight highly correlates with their next
generation’s eyesight.</p>

<p>similar factors such as facial appearance, height,
figure(skinny/fat)…even iq.</p>

<p>bear in mind the rule of natural selection, we humans also tend to
select partners of fewer genetic disadvantages so as to produce next
generation with higher competitiveness. this may sound cruel, for it
means only people with fewer disadvantages can find a partner and have
children.</p>

<p>of course, the above will be all nonsense when this question pops up,
WHAT ABOUT LOVE? right, when it comes to love, everything else doesn’t
seem to matter.</p>

<p>good news is that statistics guarantee only a possibility, not a result.
so with effort, one or one’s children could still overturn genetic
disadvantages and become more ‘perfect’. but there are something more
severe, called genetic defects, which may cause genetic diseases, often
incurable. parents should pay special attention and try to make the
right decision.</p>

<p>at last, i apologize to anyone who’s annoyed or irritated by this post,
and i apologize for being aggressive and giving immature opinions.</p>
