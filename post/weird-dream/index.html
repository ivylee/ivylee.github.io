		<p>I was extremely scared of death.<br />
 In the middle of my sleep this early morning, a sudden fear came to me.
My heart was beating so fast that I almost could not breathe. The whole
family knew the date of the deaths of both my sister and brother had
come. It was like the darkest day of my life. Both my sister and brother
had a strange disease which would cause their deaths by the time they
reached certain age. My family had tried every possible method to escape
this curse but in vain, the time of death had arrived. Thinking all
about this, I didn’t have the courage to face them. Finally, I found my
brother, and he was so quiet. He knew all his life, that the end would
be like this. He didn’t say a word to me but I could see he was in the
greatest pain. Knowing the fact but could do nothing to change it was
the most unacceptable part. I just fell in his arms and cried. Then I
saw my sister with red and tearful eyes, she comforted me.<br />
 That was the end of my dream. I felt I was lucky to get out of that
dream ASAP cause it really frightened me. Then I remembered the other
dream I had about death, in which I died, I tried to find some
resemblance, but nothing. The only thing I’ve learnt from these dreams
is that I am extremely afriad of death. I don’t want to die now, I don’t
want anyone around me to die.</p>
