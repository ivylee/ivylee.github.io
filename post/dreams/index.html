		<p>Part Une<br />
 One night in last month, I had a dream which I experienced death in. I
was on a geographical study tour organized by school with teachers and
friends walking in the street of Hong Kong. The street was in chaos, I
believed, and we called the police. The police&rsquo;s reply was that under
the special circumstances like that, the police force couldn&rsquo;t help us.
We were on our own. Then the camera moved to another stage where the
group of us were walking up a slope. Suddenly a grenade-like object fell
from the sky and I yelled &lsquo;Everyone get down!&rsquo; but nobody listened until
a few secs later it exploded. I was on the ground covering my head while
some of my friends got injured. Not long after that, men in black jumped
out of all the vans nearby and pointed their gun at us. We had no option
but to do as they said. We were taken to the basement of an abandoned
building. They told us to line up and sit down. We all followed their
instruction. Then they began to shoot us, one by one. My friends died in
front of me. Out of nowhere, my hand grabbed a gun. I was almost lying
on the ground when I tried so hard to shoot the bad guys. What I did was
in vain. Finally a bullet went through my heart and I was dead. That was
when I woke up, shivering. I was so afraid that what I dreamt might
actually happen one day. Then I went back into the dream to see if there
was a slightest chance to turn things around. Although my body was dead,
I was conscious. Things went on as the movie The Butterfly Effect. I
tried to pretend to be a doctor and said I was of value to them. I even
dressed the leader&rsquo;s injury. Nothing went on. Then I jumped to the scene
when I was running after my teacher. He was supposed to protect me and
we were supposed to get out of there together. We ran from the basement
to the top of the building. Apparently there was no way to go any
further. My dream stuck there and ended.<br />
 Part Deux<br />
 A few days earlier, I had another weird dream. [The maths teacher who
taught me during senior 2 is called M. And now my maths teacher is
called G.] M&rsquo;s baby was born a couple of months ago so M had been taking
vacation to look after his wife and baby. But he returned one day to
teach us. We had been taught by G ever since we were senior 3. We didn&rsquo;t
know that G was a substitute for the period. But the problem was that
we(more specifically, I) like G very much and I hate M. M was old,
boring and annoying. But my memory flashed back to the first day G met
us. His words suggested he was not permanent. It was then did I know M
was to teach us instead of G. As I was thinking about it, M started his
lesson and G was sitting on the right side of the classroom. G was
smiling, quietly paying attention to M, like M was his teacher. We were
angry about M teaching us again. So once we had the chance, we laughed
at him. We expressed our dissatisfaction in every possible way but M
still wouldn&rsquo;t go away, G was still smiling gently. That was when I woke
up, asking myself &ldquo;R U out of ur mind?&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t know what I think about
later. I just put it behind.</p>
