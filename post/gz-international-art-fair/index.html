      <p>It’s fantastic!<br />
 The greatest part was meeting Isabelle DURET-DUJARRIC and her great
work of art including paintings and statues. Her paintings have such
striking colors that immediately attracts everyone entered through the
east gate. They’re rich, full of light, energy and love and passion for
life. To me, they’re more than Van Gogh’s Sun Flowers. photos will be
added later.<br />
 Isabelle’s paintings are the most wonderful of the whole show. I’m a
little disappointed by the works of Chinese artists. Even I can tell
they’re lack of creativity.<br />
 When I was in a french artist’s spot, I heard a man judging her work.
At first I thought he meant well, and I did a little translation for him
and Ms.Maryline, the artist. But later, the Chinese man became not so
respectful in choosing his words. He said something about his study of
Chinese culture and technology. I wonder what kind of man studies
culture and technology at the same time? He was enjoying himself,
clearly, saying the artist’s work of cultural mix was shallow, at least
the reflection of both French culture and Chinese culture was not deep
enough. I hated to do that, translating everything as the man asked. And
I hated myself for not being able to find some nice words to soften his
opinion. Ms.Maryline explained she was only in China for 2 yrs and the
man showed no comprehension for that. The errogant man judged, did not
appreciate.<br />
 After receiving souvenir from Ms.Maryline, we ran away asap from the
man. The rest of the journey wasn’t as exciting as before. Soon we left
for lunch at the M.</p>
