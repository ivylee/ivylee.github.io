    <div class="content">
      <p>Today I took a taste of Parallel Programming course from CS dept,
expecting it to be about achieving parallelization using a low-level
language like C/C++ with intensive knowledge on computer theory etc.,
however it turned out to be lectured by a researcher at IBM who
introduced a language, X10, built on top of Java, with functional
programming concept as in Scala. As X10 focuses on concurrency there’s
new types and ‘struct’ as in C/C++. By using a simple example the class
discussed common problems arise in concurrent computation, as appeared
in using Hadoop.</p>

<p>Based on what I’ve learned today it seems the advantage of X10 is
concurrency without the limitation of map-reduce paradigm. However X10
is still under development, and seemed to be only used at IBM. Its
popularity should increase by time, especially for tasks that are found
to be difficult to tackle with Hadoop.</p>
