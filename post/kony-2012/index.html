    <div class="content">
      <p>learned about Kony 2012 campaign yesterday, from sina weibo
<strong>suprisingly not from twitter since i haven’t been checking my timeline
often</strong></p>

<p>then i watched the campaign video. it talked about the crimes of the
leader of LRA, a rebellion group whose base was once uganda, which i
infer from the map change. the LRA leader, joseph kony, commits war
crimes, abducts kids, turning boys into soldiers girls into sex slaves.
kony fights without outside support, and is presumably good at hiding
and fighting in the woods. invisible children inc., presumably lead by
the narrator of the video, filmed frightened kids who were afraid of
abduction, set out to help those kids by raising the awareness of this
issue and setting up proper schools for them. and now they want more
people to know about joseph kony, by making this video and planning
following actions. they have asked us government to send troops to help
local forces finding kony and they have asked many celebrities and
politicians for their influence.</p>

<p>but why this year? the video will be expired at the end of 2012, why?
looking at a broader picture, i guess the only answer is the us
government has set a date that their deployed troops in uganda or where
they are needed to be have to return, whether the mission succeed or
not; or there’s no fixed date, but troops will be returned if there’s no
consistent or increasing support of this campaign/mission. that’s why
the invisible children inc. tries so hard to push and gain support of
their cause. but i don’t see national even global support is the
concrete solution of this problem. demands of such cause cannot assure
capture of the bad guy, it would only turn into pressure for us
government which, from my point of view, can be easily set aside, either
by a strong will to abort the mission or by raising another urgent
issue. and this is the election year, invisible children inc. cleverly
use it and gather support from both parties. it’s not likely to become a
big issue in election campaign nonetheless candidates will have to treat
it or use it wisely.</p>

<p>westerners go to africa, see the lives of poor africans and do their
best to save them. this kind of story has been told and has been going
on. almighty west saves the world. but is this how the world functions?
the video made by invisible children inc. did not talk anything about
how kony became a rebellion, what was the problem in those areas of
africa that was causing the fight. what was kony fighting for? just to
abduct more kids? this is the central cause of conflict. and how do the
military forces in africa deal with this rebellion group? i learn
nothing from the video. when there’s long term conflict or insolvable
issue or running criminals in other parts of the world, americans ask
their government to send troops and deal with it, on other countries’
land, all due to americans idea of humanity and justice, does this sound
weird? americans are so heroic, they must think african people need them
badly.</p>

<p>kony already knows the americans are after him. when he will be
captured, dead or alive is an interesting question which defines the
success of invisible children inc. and the us government operations. if
kony is captured by the end of this year, this case will surely be an
example of us-defended-humanity-by-military-intervention-abroad. if
failed or discontinued at some point, those americans will be greatly
embarrassed and operations of this kind will definitely be harder than
before.</p>

<p>it’s not true that only the americans care about these issues, it’s just
that they are good at campaigning. after i watch the campaign video, i
signed the pledge too. but then i cooled down my head, hesitated and
wondered if this is a proper approach of solving problems like this.
campaigns do not actually solve the problem it’s for sure. various
doubts on this campaign and the video are plenty on youtube and other
websites.</p>

<p>social media spread issues can quickly capture people’s eyes and minds,
and even blind them. stay clear and stay alert. try to ask yourself a
few questions before retweeting. i’ll be keeping track of this campaign
cuz the result will definitely be interesting.</p>
