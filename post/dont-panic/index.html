      <p>It is probably the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Panic_(The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy)">best
advice</a>
given to human race.</p>

<p>At first, it seemed the city was overreacting. Shutting down public
transportation, stopping schools, gathering food and water. All this,
seemed unreal until I lost electricity at around 8.30 pm Oct. 29th.</p>

<p>Few minutes before that, I had my tv turned on, following the news while
I had dinner. A man in uniform knocked on my door and asked if I had
opened my windows since there were some strange noise and other
residents complained. Of course I didn’t open my windows and I heard the
noise too! Fortunately I wasn’t the only one that found the noise
unpleasant. I grabbed a notice on the door handle regarding the storm as
he left.</p>

<p>Just as I was going to clean up, after a flash everything went dark. Oh,
power outage hit me.</p>

<p>Don’t panic.</p>

<p>I didn’t have my flash light prepared, because I never thought I’d be
using it. After a while scrambling over my drawers in the dark, I
managed to find my small carry-around flash light but no batteries. But
I knew I brought one with me from China. So all I had to do was look
again, this time more carefully. Then I found one, and another one. But
getting a flash light didn’t help. I could do nothing about the
electricity. I went out to the hall way, all the emergency lights on,
and nobody was there. It was quiet. I guessed nobody panicked, which was
great. Then I came back, wondering what I could do. I dialed the numbers
on the notice and confirmed the whole building was in power outage and
there was no news about when it would come back. I looked outside the
window, funny thing was I could see the border of power outage, just
right across the street. On the left everything was dark, on the right
everything lit up. And police cars were rushing towards the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>I couldn’t study, which was what I planned for the night. I had to save
the laptop battery, it was charged about 100%. I got the Powerbank, also
from China, to charge my phone. I sent msgs with friends and family, did
the trash, washed the dishes, showered and flossed before going to bed
with sirens and lights outside.</p>

<p>At 3 am I woke up, it was still noisy. It is always noisy here, sirens
roaring from 11 pm till midnight all the way through morning. I tried
the lamp, still dark anyway. Then I went back to sleep, hoping things
would work in the morning.</p>

<p>Around 8.40 am, I got up and tried the lights, still the same. I still
had hot water, everything except electricity. My stove wasn’t working. I
had to think about my food. Luckily without planning for emergency, I
had bread, milk, orange juice, tomatoes, cucumbers, bananas and green
grapes, all of which could be consumed without cooking. But I’d like my
milk to be warm. The solution was filling the stockpot with hot tap
water and put my mug with milk in. So I had a nice breakfast as usual,
warm milk and a banana.</p>

<p>I dialed the numbers on the notice again, no news for power recovery. I
had to figure out what to do for a whole day and worry about getting to
school tomorrow if subway service was still suspended. About 6.5 hrs of
battery left on my laptop. So I wrote this post and then started reading
the textbook to prepare for midterm on Thursday morning.</p>

<p>Around noon, I noticed water coming out of my tap much more slower than
usual. Worried that I might run out of it, I saved some using pans and
anything that seemed to be capable of storing water. About half an hour
later, the nightmare happened. No electricity, no water. I couldn’t even
flush the toilet. One can live without electricity but NOT without
water! This was the moment that I really panicked. I needed a place to
live! Survive! I had to abandon my apt! I tried to call management
office to confirm the water outage, but they didn’t seem to know what
was going on.</p>

<p>I was very lucky. After posting on facebook and a few text msgs, I had
options of places to stay. I had been very lucky since I came to New
York. Life is an adventure. You’ll never know where it takes you,
especially in face of disaster and uncertainty. I’d never thought the
following days would turn out to be one of the happiest week of my life,
the happiest I could be in the shadow of the storm.</p>

<p>I left my apt in the afternoon of Oct 30th, came back in the morning of
Nov 4th. I might have been the luckiest and happiest refugee. Everything
looked intact. All I needed to do was some cleaning, and life went back
to normal. I did have a secret small wish that I could stay longer as a
refugee. But life goes on! And life is better now that I have all those
warm and happy memories.</p>

<p>C’est la vie. C’est ma vie.</p>
