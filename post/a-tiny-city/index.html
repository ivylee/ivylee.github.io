		<p>3 days ago, accompanying my mother, I arrived at Shantou, a small/tiny
city along the south coast of China. My primary intention is to visit my
grandma who’s already 78 years old. However, this is a tiny city where
infomation about people coming and going spreads faster than you think,
in such case, my mother said we couldn’t stay here without visiting her
rather close relatives. So I had to follow her almost everywhere as I
felt it obligatory to do so.<br />
 Went out to meet a friend at a KTV and I didn’t sing at all. It was
always awkard for me to go to kareokes because I rarely sing in front of
people, unless they’re really very close friends. Not until I had to
look up the map for transportation means did I realized that I lived far
from downtown. There were only 2 bus lines out.<br />
 This is a boring city and its language sounds like french to me. I was
just understanding very few words within any conversation. Sometimes
familiar words pop up and disappear in less than a sec, and reappear and
disappear few secs later. Frustrating! But some words sound funny to
certain extent, which means I’d laugh when I hear them but my mother’d
think I’m crazy/stupid.<br />
 Later I discovered, actually my mother discovered a funny line came
from a loudspeaker on the street, outside a shoe shop. In mandarin it
was “平平钱，买双鞋穿趣味”. It rhymes with the sound ‘i’. Loudspeaker is
the symbol of stores selling low-price goods. Very often sound from the
loudspeaker was a male/female’s voice saying ‘the goods are very cheap
here! come and buy! or u’ll regret it! because we’re closing up! this is
ur last chance!’. It’s clear that the speaker is playing what is
recorded over and over again that it sometimes becomes an unbearable
noise, just driving people away asap from the coverage of that speaker.
However, that very line reflected the differences between people in ST
and GZ. Here the people learned the style of selling from GZ and added
their own language and attitude of life. They are casual, content though
their living standard isn’t even comparable to that of GZ. I’ve never
heard of Cantonese buying shoes just for fun and low-price, they care
more about brand and quality. My mother and I thought the line was so
brilliant that we deliberately went by that store to hear it again, and
I asked her to repeated it for me several times on our way home.<br />
 Paid a visit to the notorious boat-bridge which charges 60 for entrance
fee, and the newly accomplished ST 1st Middle School campus. The later
was pretty much like the HEMC of GZ, beautiful but one of the
administrators, my mother’s uncle, told us it’ll take 6 yrs to fully pay
the debts, a long long way to go.<br />
 When I stay in, I read and sleep and watch tv and surf the net and of
course, write this. There’s nothing better to do. I’m glad I finished
reading To Kill a Mocking Bird which is such a great novel, friendly
words with profound meanings.<br />
 One thing I have to mention particularly, is that I hate the motorbikes
here, they’re absolutely outrageous.<br />
