		<p>after Chelsea go level with Man Utd at the top of the table with a
victory against the Red Devils at Stamford Bridge, 26th Apr. 2008<br />
<br />
 “We needed to win. I said in my programme notes that a win was an
absolute must today,” declared Terry after the game.<br />
<br />
 “We’ve got the win, with two great goals from Bally [Michael
Ballack].”<br />
<br />
 “We got a free-kick from Didier [Drogba] on the edge of the half-way
line. We should have killed the game and put it long as we did most of
the game to Didier,” said a rueful Terry. “We rushed the free-kick,
which shouldn’t be done. We should have killed it off then.”<br />
<br />
 “I think you’ve seen today, clearly, it’s in all our minds, we want to
win the Premiership and take it away from Man United,” he said.<br />
<br />
 “We’ve got the advantage today - we’ve beaten them at home - we’ve not
lost at home in a long time.<br />
<br />
 “We’ve shown people today. All season long we’ve had to put up with
‘Chelsea can’t play as well as Man United or Arsenal’, I think we showed
people today we can match anybody on our day.”<br />
