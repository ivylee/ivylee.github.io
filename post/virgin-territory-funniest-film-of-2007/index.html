		<p>Virgin Territory is crap, yet the funniest crap I’ve ever seen. Hayden
and Mischa must have been out of their minds to act in this film, and
they did it the most terrible way which earns them a great deal of
criticism. And of course, poor Matthew Rhys was in it, but he wasn’t
awkward, he was just pure fun. Matthew Rhys, Tim Roth and the guy
playing the ‘priest’ handled their parts very well, presenting the story
as it should be-a crazy funny one. The following lines were the
beginning of my laughter during the film:<br />
 Gerbino[Tim Roth] and his men chased down Count Dzerzhinsky[Matthew
Rhys]. Gerbino sent one of his men to kill Count Dzerzhinsky with a
sword. As the man was approaching Count Dzerzhinsky, he was shot by
Count Dzerzhinsky and dead. Then Gerbino said to his men,<br />
 “What’s that? You see that? Fantastic! I want that! Get me that!” Then
his men rushed to Count Dzerzhinsky.<br />
 Then I realized, gun was an advanced weapon at that time.<br />
 There are also other funny lines which can be read here <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0437954/quotes">Memorable
