		<p>what was I doing? what am I doing?<br />
 there r so many things in life worth fighting for and I’d be willing to
fight for. why would grades, marks, results become so important in the
first place? since when? o right, primary school? or even earlier,
kindergarden? it has become a habit that I couldn’t get rid of. looking
at the scores, I couldn’t help but feeling sad, then I ask myself, why
should I feel sad? they’re just numbers, I didn’t like anything I’ve
learnt from school/university, I didn’t care, for those subjects. but my
future is very much likely to depend on these numbers and so I must make
them look good. I’ve gone through the same reasoning procedure for about
a million times. still, I’m frustrated, confused, contradicted.<br />
 in the pursuit of grades, there’s no happiness, even if I achieve my
goal gpa, there would be no joy, only less pain. but the pursuit of
grades is within the pursuit of my future happiness, so I should stick
to the plan. but if I do this, it will eliminate all my present
happiness, when I in the future look back upon now, will I be regretted?
I live in today, right now at this moment. and in every moment in my
life, I need happiness, I don’t need grades. f*ck, it doesn’t make
sense. what went wrong? am I not thinking logically?<br />
