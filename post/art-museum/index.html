		<p>visited the art museum for the European masterpiece of 19C. i’ve never
seen authentic classic paintings before. it was fresh experience. i
don’t know about most of the painters but i was and have always been
amazed by how they could create such realistic characters, sometimes
even more beautiful than the truth. however, my favourite style of
painting remains impressionism. unfortunately there weren’t enough great
works for me to fulfill my expectation. around 5 pm I was hurried out by
a security who did annoyed me a little. despite that, i enjoyed this
afternoon, especially after wondering around the beautiful ErSha Island
looking for the bus station to go home. only on ErSha island can you
find the ‘vast’ land of ‘forest’, in GZ.</p>
