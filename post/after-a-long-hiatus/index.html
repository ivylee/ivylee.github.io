		<p>I want to write again.</p>

<p>But first I needed to migrate my blog from Octopress to Ghost.
I was happy with Octopress until I discovered every update/push took forever because I have 200+ posts.</p>

<p>Migration was not easy. Took me almost 4 nights. Essentially the problems for me were:</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t push the markdown files that are supposed to be under <code>source/_posts</code> to github.
So I only have a bunch of published html files waiting to be converted back to markdown.
During conversion it&rsquo;s tricky to deal with Chinese characters, took me 1-2 nights to figure out.
Loading Octopress markdown files to Ghost database. There&rsquo;s a nice script available however some tweaks were needed to suit my use case.
I decided not to integrate Disqus comments for now. Don&rsquo;t worry I still have your previous comments in heart.</p>

<p>Please check out <a href="https://github.com/ivylee/octoghost">this</a> repo if you&rsquo;re wondering whether my experience might be helpful to you.</p>

<p>Finally I like the combination of <a href="https://ghost.org">Ghost</a> + <a href="https://github.com/axitkhurana/buster">Buster</a> + <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>
as described <a href="https://jackpearce.com/have-a-lightning-fast-blog-and-host-it-for-free">here</a> :) And I&rsquo;m writing again!</p>
