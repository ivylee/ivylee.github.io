		<p>Exclusive Interview with French Artist Isabelle: Art to Me is as Water
to Fish<br />
 Updated Nov 28 2007 13:13:20 Beijing Time<br />
<br />
 Isabelle DURET-DUJARRIC, one of the top ten contemporary artists in
France, is invited to be a V.I.P. to join the 12th Guangzhou Art Fair
which is to be launched on November 29.<br />
 Reporter with
<a href="http://www.lifeofguangzhou.com/">www.lifeofguangzhou.com</a> has been
granted an exclusive interview with her, concerning her works, her
would-be exhibition in the art fair, and future plans in China.<br />
 **<br />
 Strong colors, powerful shock<br />
<br />
** People who appreciate her work are impressed by the bold colors and
image her as an active artist. In our interview, however, she tended to
be surprisingly quiet. Discussing the colors used in her printings,
Isabelle explained that the red color, her favorite color, symbolizes
the power of life. Different viewers will appreciate her works from
different angels.<br />
<br />
 Isabelle’s works range from sculpture, watercolor, oil painting to
print and feature landscapes and Mediterranean figures as the subjects.
She created the skills of oil paintings on thick pasteboard, which is
now being widely introduced to universities of fine art.<br />
<br />
 **Art to me is as water to fish<br />
**<br />
 Asked which is her favorite medium, Isabelle blurted out without
hesitation “All are important.” As the child in the artistically
inherited family, Isabelle began to study painting at the age of 3.
Under Parisian artists’ instruction, she soon acquainted herself in the
art world.<br />
<br />
 Isabelle appraises herself as an inner-hot/outer-cold person. “I would
like to show the hottest part on the paper. Art is important in my life,
as important as the water to fish.”<br />
<br />
 <strong>The first western artist invited by Guangzhou Art Fair</strong><br />
<br />
 Famed in the worldly art and collection circle, Isabelle has showcased
her works in dozens of countries around the world. Over 600 masterpieces
are now treasured in the private collectors’ houses. From entering the
market circulation, her works have roughly appreciated over 10 times.<br />
<br />
 Isabelle’s serendipity with China can be traced back 20 years ago. In
1987, her solo exhibition in Beijing was the first one by a foreign
artist since 1949, when New China was founded. In 2004, the year of
Sino-French culture exchange, Isabelle brought her works to the Shanghai
Art Fair.<br />
<br />
 Isabelle was the first western artist invited by the 11th Guangzhou
International Art Fair in 2006. This year, she comes back as a V.I.P. to
join the 12th, together with 60 pieces, the same pieces which are
considered hits from her former exhibitions.<br />
<br />
 <strong>Masterpiece as gift to Guangzhou Museum</strong><br />
<br />
 Meanwhile, Isabelle will donate one of her paintings to the Guangzhou
Museum during the Guangzhou tour. The painting entitled “la Calanque,”
valued at over one million RMB in the art market, is as significant as
Isabelle’s amulet. Wherever Isabelle goes for exhibition, she brings it
with her.</p>

<br />
 la Calanque</p>

<p>The painting portrays a scene of huge stones, hot sunshine and cool
beach, symbolizing the pursuit of dream and the satisfaction of reaching
goal. Mr. Jacques TOUBON, the minister of French Culture Department,
also expresses his great fondness to the works.<br />
<br />
 <strong>Guangzhou is like the south part of France</strong><br />
<br />
 Having visited China’s Beijing and Shanghai, Isabelle’s affection
toward Guangzhou is no doubt. She said, Guangzhou reminds her of the
south part in France. The art atmosphere is similar and ultimately
dynamic.<br />
<br />
 At the end of our interview, Isabelle disclosed that she would have a
series of promotion plans in her China tour soon.<br />
