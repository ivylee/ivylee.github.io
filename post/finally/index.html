		<p>I think I’ve had enough of these crazy exams. And I don’t care about the
results anymore. Go to hell!<br />
 The saddest thing on earth is that I only have 7 days off, not enough
for everything I want or need to do. Music, movie, tv, magazines, books,
sports…all of them gave me endless joy I just couldn’t have it all.<br />
 This school year has been the worst one of my life. I’ve never hated
school as much as I do now. Unfortunately, everything sucks.<br />
 Far far away from a ‘fabulous 2008’.</p>
