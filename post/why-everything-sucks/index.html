      <p>about the entering ceremony of the sports meet:<br />
 it’s ridiculous. about 60 students standing in the playground, a bunch
of these and a bunch of that moving like sand pouring out everywhere.
thanks to this lousy idea: Americans attack Iraq, then out of nowhere
Iraqis score a goal in a football match winning the title. it took us
almost 45 mins to simply get the clue of it.<br />
 about the class uniform:<br />
 last year it was an out-dated pink shirt, on which the perfect logo can
hardly be seen. this year there’s gonna be a new one. but what’s going
to be on the shirt was also ridiculous: a vegetable (i don’t know what
it’s called) with a wire and a plug, another wire and a plug and a
lighted bulb. the people who designed it said the vegetable and the wire
pronounced similar to our class teacher’s name. that’s all they could
think of! I don’t want to wear a shirt with my teacher’s name on it,
especially when I hate him! How am I going to explain to others when
they ask what’s this shirt about? It would be most embarrassing. So I
guess I won’t wear it for a second time.<br />
 conclusion: students in charge of my class are idiots. I have to
survive under idiot leaders.</p>
