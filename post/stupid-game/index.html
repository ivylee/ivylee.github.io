		<p>就是在图书馆过夜，which I did play last night.<br />
 I came up this stupid yet tempting idea couple of days ago. I had
always thought it would be fun, but unfortunately I’m a moron. So I
tried to collect 3 smart friends to be my companions. One of them was
actually wise enough to leave us at 9:45 pm. The rest of us hopefully
arrived at the 24-hour study room, which was surprisingly small and
crowded. Then the long journey began.<br />
 I was fully charged. But,</p>

<hr />

<p>[15:54pm]My wise friend called me asking how was last night. I told her
it sucked. I never realize how crazy and stupid I am until now. It’s now
even painful to recall my thoughts about this whole idea. So I might as
well stop here for now. And continue when my mind is not in a chaos.</p>

<hr />

<p>Dec.16th.<br />
 It was a mistake.</p>
